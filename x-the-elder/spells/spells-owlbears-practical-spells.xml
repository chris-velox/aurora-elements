            <p>You cause a tiny ceramic animal to magically be able to hold many more coins than normal. For the duration, the container is able to hold up to 1000 coins that are deposited into its coin slot. The container weighs less than a pound, regardless of its contents.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, a creature can flip the container over a tap the bottom which ejects a random coin from inside the container to be ejected from the coin slot.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the stopper is magically ejected and all of the coins in the container spill out. Pulling the stopper out early ends the spell. Putting anything other than coins into the container or putting the container into any other extradimensional space ends the spell. Damaging the container ends the spell. You can’t have more than one Piggy Bank at a time. Casting this spell again ends the effect on the first container.</p>

You can command the quill to transcribe the speech of any creature within 30 feet as long as you understand the language. You can command the quill to copy the contents of any non-magical open book, scroll or sheaf of parchment within 5’ of it onto an empty book, scroll or sheaf of parchment papers. The quill copies quickly at the rate of 1 page per minute and requires a normal amount of ink. Spellbooks and Spell Scrolls are magical and cannot be copied.</p>

            <p>You cause a container you touch to become able to crush objects into a small space. Choose a non-magical container of up to 6 cubic feet (a standard barrel is 5 and a half cubic feet). While closed it exerts tremendous crushing force on any objects placed inside. The container isn’t damaged by objects put inside of it. After 1 minute of crushing, all objects in the closed container are packed into a dense cube. The total weight remains the same but the cube’s volume is 1/8th the volume of all the objects put inside (one size category smaller). Liquids and magical items are unaffected by the crushing and stay at the bottom of the bag rather than being packed into the cube.</p>

            <p>This spell creates a temporary quasi-real workshop in a 10’x10’ area. Choose a type of artisan’s tools, a workshop containing those tools and its associated gear appears. For example, choosing Smith’s Tools would cause quasi-real hammers, tongs, pliers to appear along with an anvil, forge, fuel and bellows. A person who is proficient with the chosen tools can use this phantom workshop as effectively as a real workshop.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any of the equipment or materials created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried outside the area or when the spell ends. Therefore, it’s necessary to provide real raw materials to create anything that lasts after the spell ends.</p>

            <p>As you cast this spell, an unlabeled 10 x 10 mile map of your surroundings scribes itself onto the parchment. Geographical features such as forests, mountains, rivers, lakes, oceans, etc. as well as permanent settlements and roads are all visible. Finer details such as individual buildings aren’t visible. A small ‘X’ indicates the caster’s current location.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell fails if the caster is not on the Prime Material plane. It also fails if there are Gates, portals to other planes or any other non-Euclidean geometries within the 10 x 10 mile area.</p>

            <p>This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs complex tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 10, and it can’t attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has the same tool, vehicle, game and instrument proficiencies that you do and makes ability checks with the same modifiers as you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the apprentice to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The apprentice can perform complex tasks that a human apprentice with your proficiencies could do, such as pumping bellows, playing dragon chess, crafting weapons, picking locks, playing a song, cooking food, and mending armor. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. The apprentice requires the raw materials to complete the task to be provided for it. The apprentice can use the Help action to assist you with ability checks that use your tool, vehicle, game or instrument proficiencies.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.</p>
