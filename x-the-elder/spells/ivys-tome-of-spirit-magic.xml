            <p>You attempt to compel a creature’s spirit to the afterlife. A creature you see within range must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 1d6 force damage, or 1d12 force damage if the target is an undead.</p>
            <p class="indent">The damage dealt increases at higher levels: 2d6 (or 2d12) at 5th level, 3d6 (or 3d12) at 11th level, and 4d6 (or 4d12) at 17th level.</p>

            <p class="indent">If you are proficient with the ability check or saving throw, the die changes to a d6 as your own familiarity with the task helps to channel the experiences of your ancestors.</p>

            <p>You point at an undead creature that can see and hear you and command it to fully manifest into the current plane. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or lose its resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as any incorporeal movement it may have for the duration.

This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You stare with sharp intent at a creature within range in an attempt to peer into its soul. You learn general knowledge about its life, and if the creature is an undead or otherwise had a past life, you also learn about its former life. For example, you may learn the following about it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Its approximate age.</li>
                <li>Its general disposition and happiness.</li>
                <li>Its most recent profession, occupation, or similar role.</li>
                <li>Any significant past traumas it has suffered.</li>
                <li>When it died (if applicable).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">An unwilling target can make an Intelligence saving throw to try to avoid this effect. On success it reveals no information or potentially even false information about itself. Constructs and creatures immune to divination magic do not reveal any information.</p>

            <p>A ring of translucent blue flames briefly flares out from you in all directions. The ghostly flames spread around corners and trace the contours of the terrain. Creatures within 20 feet of you must each succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage and become faintly outlined in a pale blue aura that lasts until the end of your next turn. On success a creature takes half as much damage and is not outlined.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any attack roll against an outlined creature has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature can’t benefit from being invisible.</p>

            <p>You create an intangible spirit of shimmering white light at a spot you can see within range, remaining for the spell’s duration. The spirit takes the rough form of a Medium or smaller humanoid or beast and emits a luminescent aura that radiates in all directions for 20 feet, warding against certain creatures. The region inside this aura is bright light, and it emits dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">Aberrations, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls and perception checks against targets inside the aura. An aberration, fiend, or undead who starts its turn inside the aura or first moves into it on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d8 radiant damage on failure or half as much on success.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can move the spirit and its aura up to 30 feet on subsequent turns but must use your full action to do so. The spell ends if the spirit moves outside the spell’s range.</p>

            <p>You call forth a spirit from the Shadowfell, binding it into your servitude. Select one of the following effects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An incorporeal undead creature of challenge rating 5 or lower appears in an unoccupied space you can see, such as a ghost or a wraith.</li>
                <li>You select a Large or smaller corpse or pile of bones within range and a corporeal undead of challenge rating 5 or lower rises from it. The undead creature must not be larger than the size of the corpse or pile of bones, and if you select a corpse the undead must be of an appropriate form for it. The creature does not have any equipment that is not present on the corpse or pile of bones when the spell is cast.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">The undead creature returns to the Shadowfell when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends, leaving behind its material body (if it has one). It is loyal to only you for the duration. Roll initiative for the undead, which has its own turns. It understands and obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the undead, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your concentration is broken, the undead doesn’t disappear. Instead, the undead stops being loyal to you and becomes hostile toward you and your companions. An uncontrolled undead can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. The DM has the undead’s statistics.</p>
