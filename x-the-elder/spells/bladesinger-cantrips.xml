            <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. For the purposes of this spell, your weapon is considered to have the reach property. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and it’s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you move 20 feet or more in a straight line toward the target before casting this spell, you can cast this spell as a bonus action, rather than an action. Once you cast this spell as a bonus action using this ability, you cannot cast the spell again until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage to the target. This damage roll increases by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.</p>

            <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and its speed is reduced to zero, and it can’t benefit from any bonuses to speed. This effect lasts until the target succeeds on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to your spell save DC, which can be made as a bonus action on the target’s turn, or until the start of your next turn, at which point the target takes and additional 1d6 cold damage if it has not moved.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for for not moving increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.</p>
