            <p>By touching a willing creature, you can provide false information to those that would try to discover their true intentions. If the target becomes the target of a spell or ability that would detect their alignment or their creature type, you can designate a false response to that spell or ability.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, you could use this spell to make a creature appear evil to other creatures, or to appear to be a celestial to all that would try to discern what it really is.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You point at a space within range and blow the whistle used in the casting. A distant whistle echoes as a spectral train makes its way towards the space you pointed, stopping in front of you. The train is innately magical, requiring no crew to run it. it is 20 feet wide and is comprised of ten cars which can hold up to 50 creatures, as well as the engine car, all of which are 20 feet long. If you and any creatures of your choice step into the train, you become incorporeal and can interact with the train as a solid object. While on the train, you don’t need to breathe, eat, drink or sleep. A creature that steps off of the train ceases to be incorporeal.</p>
            <p class="indent">The ghost train can travel in any direction except above the ground, regardless of physical boundaries, due to its incorporeal nature, and travels at 100 miles an hour in the chosen direction. It requires no tracks and travels in whatever direction you choose. When the spell ends, all creatures are removed from the train.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, the train can, at your command, ram into the souls of others at high speed. As an action, you can cause the train to become solid until the end of your next turn, as well as all creatures currently on the train. If the train comes into contact with a creature in that time, it must make a Dexterity saving throw</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> If this spell is cast with a 9th level spell slot, the duration becomes 8 hours.</p>

Creatures that start their turn in the aura or enter the aura for the first time on their turn must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature sees the closest creature as an enemy and immediately becomes hostile towards it for the duration. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected. A creature that touches the sphere is immediately affected by the spell, regardless of saving throws. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

            <p>By touching a creature within range, you can force it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a fail, you pull the creature into its mind and show it its worst fears. The creature becomes stunned for the duration and must make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turns, taking 2d6</p>
            psychic damage on a failed save. For the duration, you can use your action to probe the creature’s mind and forcing the creature to make a Charisma check contested by your own. If you win, you learn some of the creature’s darkest fears and secrets, as well as other information that the creature has that it considers secret or sensitive. If the creature wins, it can repeat the spell’s saving throw. The spell ends if you cease touching the creature or if it takes damage from a source other than this spell.

Motes of energy arc out from the point to the ground at three different points you can see within 20 feet of the initial point. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose, as well as the initial area, must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage and 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

You are proficient with this weapon, and when you hit a creature with it, you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt. Undead take an additional 1d4 damage from this weapon. If you let go of the scythe, it disappears, but you can evoke the scythe again as a bonus action.</p>

All creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw saving throw as jagged spikes rise from the ground from the impact, taking 3d12 piercing damage on a failed save and half that on a successful save. If a creature occupies a space that becomes occupied by the spikes, it is pushed back 5 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spikes remain for the duration, and create a barrier around you made up of eight Medium spikes that grant you three-quarters cover to attacks originating outside the barrier. A creature that approaches the spikes from above must repeat the Dexterity saving throw or take damage from the spikes.</p>

Any creature that starts its turn in this area must make a Strength saving throw, taking 1d4 bludgeoning damage and being pulled 5 feet towards the center of the area on a failed save, or taking half that and not being pulled on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, the windstorm creates a larger area, with a radius of 60 feet, blowing at strong speeds (20 miles an hour). Any gas, vapor or fog that enters the area becomes sucked into the middle of the windstorm, preventing it from affecting the area.</p>

            <p>You launch yourself into a direction, up to 30 feet. Make a melee spell attack against the creature in the line closest to you. The attack automatically misses if the creature is more than one size category larger than you. On a hit, the creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage as it gets pulled along with you. If you hit a solid object (such as a wall, a rock or a ceiling) while a creature is pulled along, it and the object takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage. Hitting any unsecured objects moves them 10 feet in the direction you move.</p>

            <p>You ward a point within range, protecting a 30-foot radius sphere centered on that point from being interfered with by natural events. If the area inside the sphere would be subject to effects such as extreme heat or cold, being desecrated ground, or being engulfed in a storm, the spell prevents the area from being affected unless magic of 5th level or higher is used to create those effects.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, the edge of the sphere blurs, making those inside harder to detect. Creatures inside the sphere are invisible to those outside it.</p>

            <p>You imbue a creature or object within range with an intense attraction towards metallic objects. An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw to avoid being affected; otherwise it becomes a magnetar; a font of magnetic energy.</p>
            <p class="indent">The magnetar exudes a field in a 30-foot radius around it. Any ranged attack made in the aura that uses ammunition made wholly or partly from metal has disadvantage on the attack roll unless it targets the magnetar; if the attack misses, the ammunition becomes stuck to the magnetar.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any attack made against the magnetar with a metal weapon automatically hits, though the weapon becomes stuck to the magnetar after impact. A creature holding onto a metal weapon is restrained while holding onto it. A creature wearing metal armour, partially or wholly comprised of metal, or holding a metal weapon in the field must make a Strength saving throw at the start of their turn, being pulled 5 feet towards the magnetar on a failed save. A successful dispel magic (using your spell save DC) cast on the magnetar suppresses this ability until the end of your next turn.</p>

            <p>You create a 30-foot radius sphere of intense bloodlust, affecting everything inside. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes affected by the sphere, causing it to take 1d6 psychic damage if it doesn’t directly deal damage to another creature inside the sphere by the end of its turn. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of its turn if it is within the sphere.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the spell’s damage increases by 1d6 and the radius increases by 5 feet for every spell level above 6th.</p>

            <p>You create a Tiny orb of neutral energy in an unoccupied space within range. For the duration, you can use your action to target a source of damage other than bludgeoning, force, slashing, piercing or psychic (for example, a pool of lava or a storm cloud). The orb absorbs some of the energy from that source, having the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The orb increases by one size category, to a maximum of Gargantuan</li>
                <li>You add an additional dice to the spell’s damage roll</li>
                <li>The orb’s damage type changes that of the source absorbed</li>
                <li>The radius of the orb’s detonation increases by 5 feet, to a maximum of 60 feet</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">The orb’s base damage is 5d6 force damage, and the orb’s base radius is 15 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Detonating the Orb.</b> Before the spell ends, you can use your action to send the orb flying towards a point within 60 feet of it that you can see. All creatures within the orb’s current detonation radius must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the orb’s current damage dice on a failed save, or half that on a successful save. The damage type is the orb’s current type. The spell then ends.</p>

            <p>You throw a small amount of sand into the air and multiply it, creating a gust of air to send it hurtling in a line 45 feet long and 15 feet wide, heavily obscuring the area for the duration. All creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d12 slashing damage and is blinded for the duration. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of its turns, ending the blindness on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and no other effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature starts its turn in the spell’s area or moves into it for the first time in a round, it must make a saving throw against the spell.</p>
