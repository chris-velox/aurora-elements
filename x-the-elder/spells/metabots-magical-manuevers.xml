            <p>The first time before the end of your next turn you make a running jump, you instead teleport to your landing location. If this jump would take you into a Large or smaller creature’s space you appear in an unoccupied space in front of the creature (if there is none, the spell fails). The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone and if you have a free hand, is grappled by you.</p>

Each creature you choose within 30 feet of a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 4d10 lightning damage and be pulled 20 feet in a straight line towards the origin of the area of effect. On a success, it takes half damage and is not pulled.</p>
            <p class="indent">An 10 foot radius area centered at that point crackles with latent magical energy. Until the start of your next turn, the area is considered dimly lit and difficult terrain. At the start of your next turn, creatures other than you in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 thunder damage and falling prone on a failure, or half damage on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage the spell deals increases by 1d10 for each slot level above the fourth.</p>

            <p class="indent">Alternatively, you can merge with the Golem using a bonus action to assume direct control. You gain 50 temporary hit points, you have advantage on Athletics checks, your speed is doubled, and your size becomes Large. The spell ends when you run out of these temporary hit points. Damage to these temporary hit points does not count as taking damage for the purpose of maintaining concentration.

                <p>Eldritch Blade Cantrip is only supposed to be used with a host of other changes (see here). The most minimalistic change that uses it involves replacing blade pact (obviously). In essence, this change is brought about due to the fact that blade pact (and subsequent invocation tax) is ill suited for a pact as pacts are generally lower power budget ribbon-y features that don’t scale.</p>

            <p>You open your clenched hand and a glaring light pulses out, disorienting a creature within range that can see you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d4 radiant damage, and it blinded until the end of the turn.</p>

            <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a ranged attack with a melee weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. Your magic accelerates your weapon to uncanny speeds over the course of its trajectory. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects. Attacking at long range doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack roll.</p>
            <p class="indent">Alternatively, you can cast This cantrip on a weapon that doesn’t have the thrown property. It gains a thrown range of 20/60 until the end of your next turn and floats in the air close at hand, vibrating softly.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, you can use your bonus action to have the attack deal an extra 1d4 piercing damage to the target, and the damage of the spell if the the target is at long range increases to 1d8. Both damage rolls increase by one die at 11th level (2d4 or 2d8) and 17th level (3d4 or 3d8).</p>

            <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell’s range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects and if you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you siphon off a bit of its soul. Your next attack with that weapon before the end of your next turn deals additional damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target, and the necrotic damage to the following attack increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.</p>

            <p>You use your magic to crystalize a pristine glass-like weapon out of thin air. The weapon can take on the form of any melee weapon, which sublimates into nothingness at the end of your turn unless you are wielding it.</p>
            <p class="indent">An attack with the weapon does cold damage instead of its normal type, and if you score a critical hit with it, it shatters and deals an additional 1d12 cold damage. When you cast this spell, you can conjure two weapons, one in each hand, as long as both weapons are light weapons.</p>
