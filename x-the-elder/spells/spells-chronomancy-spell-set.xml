            <p>You meddle with the time of a creature or object that you can see within range. If the target is a creature, it is aged 1d4 days beyond its current age. Creatures who cannot be aged magically are unaffected by this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the target is an object, it is aged 1d4 x 5 Days instead. This could make structures become weaker or objects to break from the test of time.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell’s die increases at level 5 (2d4), at level 11 (3d4) , and at level 17 (4d4)</p>
            <p class="indent">The aging for this target lasts for 30 seconds, the creature has been healed magically (can be by potion or spell), or until a lesser restoration spell, greater restoration spell, or wish spell is used to remove the effect.</p>
