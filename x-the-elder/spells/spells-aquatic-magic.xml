            <p>As you make a horizontal slashing motion with your hands, spellcasting focus, or a weapon, a layer of water forms around it and then flies outwards. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 slashing damage and is blinded until the beginning of their next turn on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and is not blinded on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When casting this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You surround yourself with a wave of water and immediately move up to 30 feet in a straight line while being lifted 5 feet up in the air by the water. You must have at least half of your remaining movement left to cast this spell. This movement ignores opportunity attacks. Additionally, you move directly over creatures of your size or smaller, but you cannot end this movement in a target’s space unless they fail the spell’s saving throw. If the target succeeds on their saving throw, or is a size category larger than you, you end your movement directly in front of them. All creatures within 5 feet of the line you move through, or 10 feet of your location after movement must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p>

            <p>A surge of water, appears in a 15-foot cone originating from you. After spreading to the edges of the cone, the water rushes back towards you. All creatures in this area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and be pulled up to 10 feet towards you. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is pulled 5 feet towards you and is not knocked prone. A creature in water that is at least 5 feet deep has disadvantage on this saving throw and, if they would be fully submerged after being knocked prone, is pulled to within 5 feet of you on a failed save. This spell has no affect on creatures two or more size categories larger than you.</p>
