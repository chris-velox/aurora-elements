            <p>Ice crystals burst out of the ground to encase an enemy in a coffin of pure ice. Choose a creature at range. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If it fails, it takes 8d8 cold damage and is encased in a block of pure ice. If it succeeds, it only takes half damage and is not encased in ice. As long as the creature is trapped in the ice bloc, the creature is stunned and takes 1d8 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. The only way to free the creature is to attack and destroy the ice block. It has an AC equal to 10 + your spellcasting ability modifier, 100 hit points and is vulnerable to fire damage. The block is destroyed when its hit points drop to 0. Creatures immune to the stunned condition only take the initial damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the spell last for its whole duration and the creature is still alive, the creature is permanently trapped in ice. It no longer takes damage from this spell and the ice block can only get destroyed by a disintegrate, dispel magic of level 6th or higher, a wish spell or any similar kind of magic.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level of higher, the initial damage increases by 2d8 per spell level after 6.</p>

Water in the affected area becomes toxic and animals are forced to flee or die.</p>

When this period reaches its end, the poison activates and the victim must make a Constitution saving throw for, every berry that has poisoned it. The target takes 2d8 poison damage per failed save. It takes half damage when it succeeds (as an exemple, if a creature eats 3 berry and fails 2 saves, it takes 2+2+1=5d8 poison damage). If the target fails at least 1 save, it is Paralyzed for 1d6 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any non magical attempt to detect the poison fails before it activates in the victim's body.

            <p>A smoke ball forms in your palm and you throw it at a point in range. It then explodes in a whirlwind of toxic gases in a sphere of 20ft radius. Each creature caught in the explosion must make a Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take 6d6 poison damage, the others take half damage. Once you've finished the incantation, you can wait before throwing the globe. In this case, it takes the form of a 5 inch glass globe filled with noxious fumes that stays in your hand. You can then throw it (range 20ft) or with a slingshot or a catapult, or give it to a creature that can do the same. Once thrown, the globe breaks at impact, exploding like in the normal version of this spell. You can place the globe without breaking it. It explodes after a minute if it has not been broke before.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 by level after 3.</p>

            <p>You invoke up to 5 clouds of toxic fumes that each fly to the heads of one creature, preventing it from breathing. Each creature affected by a cloud must make a Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take 8d6 poison damage and are suffocating. The others take half damage and can breath normally. If a creature does not need to breath, it automatically succeeds on its saving throw. A suffocating creature suffers the effect of suffocation as described in the Player's Handbook. A creature that drops to 0 hit points because of this spells dies instantly instead of falling unconscious. Multiple clouds cannot affect the same creature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you create one more cloud by level after 6.</p>

            <p>You create the strongest poison possible and grow venomous fang at the tip of your fingers. Make a melee spell attack; If it hits, the target takes 12d12 poison damage. Those damage ignore poison damage resistance and convert poison damage immunity into resistance. The target must then make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is poisoned. A poisoned target suffers a level of exhaustion at the beginning of each of its turn. It is allowed to retry the saving throw to end its poisoned condition each time it suffers a level of exhaustion in such a way.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, you create the most powerful poison a mortal can conceive. The damage increases by 2d12 and if the targets fails its saving throw after taking the damage, it dies. If it succeeds, it is Paralyzed for 1mn. This effect ignores the Paralyzed condition immunity. \columnbreak</p>

            <p>A stream of toxic smoke burst from you and engulf everything, in a 60ft radius and 10ft high cylinder centered on you. The zone occupied by the cloud is considered heavily obscured. The cloud completely fills the space in the cylinder and turns around walls and corner, but nor through them. The cloud floats on liquids and falls, filling gaps in the grounds and falling at the edge of a cliff. If parts of the clouds falls away from you for more than 60ft, they disappear. If you go out of the cloud for more than 2 rounds of combat, the cloud disappears.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can see perfectly in the cloud. You can sens creatures entering and leaving the cloud. Any creature other than you that begins or ends its turn in the cloud or enter the cloud takes 2d6 poison damage.</p>
