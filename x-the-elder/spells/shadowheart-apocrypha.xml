            <p>You emanate an intense heat in a 10-foot radius centered on you, superheating the blood of any living creature that enters the zone. Creatures that start their turn in the radius or move into it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save a creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of each of its turns, creatures in the radius can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the creature and it is immune to this spell for 24 hours. This spell has no effect on the nonliving or creatures without blood such as constructs, oozes, plants, and undead.</p>
            <p class="indent">Blood Magic. When you cast this spell , you can choose to deal an amount of force damage to yourself equal to half your level (minimum 1), this damage ignores resistances and immunities. When you do this, creatures that fail their Constitution saving throws have their movement reduced to zero until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

Additionally, both you and the target have disadvantage on attacks and saving throws made against each other.</p>

            <p>Your curse reaches into the mind of its victim and alters its thoughts to become a protective thrall. A cursed creature within range of your choice makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is charmed by you for the duration.</p>
            <p class="indent">While it is charmed in this manner, it acts with violence towards any creature that is hostile to you, using its action to move and make weapon attacks against any creature that has attacked you since you cast this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the thrall takes damage, or at the end of each of its turns, it can make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on a success.</p>
