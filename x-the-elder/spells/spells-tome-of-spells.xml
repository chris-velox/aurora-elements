			<p>This spell surrounds you with pulsating, sparkling, glow. For the duration, if you are targeted by a spell of 6th level or lower that has a duration of Instantaneous, you may use your reaction to add your spellcasting ability modifier to your saving throw (if the spell requires one) or to your AC (if the spell requires an attack roll). As part of the same reaction, you may absorb that spell’s energy.</p>
			<p class="indent">Until the absorption spell has ended, you may then use your bonus action to either immediately cast the absorbed spell yourself at its lowest level, without spending a spell slot, or to transform the spell into a spell slot of a level equal to the spell’s lowest level.</p>

			<p>A streak of stormy-blue air flashes from your outstretched finger to a point you choose within range and then bursts into a powerful blast of air that continues to roar for the duration. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Strength saving throw.

			<p class="indent">For the duration, the area is difficult terrain. The roaring winds and stirred-up dust and water droplets also cause the area to be lightly obscured. A creature that ends its turn in that area must succeed on a Strength saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 15 feet away from the center of the sphere on a failed save, or half as much damage and isn’t pushed away on a successful one.</p>

			<p>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose one or two piles of bones or corpses of a beast of CR 1/8 or lower that is within range. Your spell animates it as a <strong>skeletal animal</strong> if you choose bones or <strong>zombie animal</strong> if you choose a corpse. Such a creature has the same statistics of a living creature of the same type, with the following changes:</p>
			<p><strong>Skeletal animals</strong> can have Intelligence scores no higher than 1, are vulnerable to bludgeoning damage, immune to poison damage, exhaustion, and the poisoned condition, and have darkvision to 60 feet. The skeletal animal’s type changes to undead.</p>
			<p><strong>Zombie animals</strong> can have Intelligence scores no higher than 1, are immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and have darkvision to 60 feet. They also have the Undead Fortitude Trait. The zombie animal’s type changes to undead.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<p><strong><em>Undead Fortitude.</em></strong> If damage reduces the zombie animal to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie animal drops to 1 hit point instead.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="indent">As undead, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or sleep, and it loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology.</p>
			<p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the undead animal for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends.

			<p>You target a creature you can see within range and force it to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature is charmed by you. For the duration, the creature forgets where it’s going and what it was planning on doing. It automatically fails any check made to determine its whereabouts or follow a trail, and it can’t read maps. It also can’t take reactions. In order to take an action other than defending itself, it must first succeed on a new Intelligence saving throw.</p>

			<p class="flavor">Source: Wizard’s Spell Compendium</p>
			<p>You create a Tiny hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand.</p>
			<p class="indent">The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to 10 + your level. It has Strength 12 (+1) and Dex 14 (+2). The hand doesn’t fill its space.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 30 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Bookworm Bane. The hand seeks out Tiny beasts and monstrosities within range with no more than 1 hit point, such as roaches and mice, and kills them.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Construction Crew.</em></strong> The hand splits into two hands and will assist you while you are working with a tool set. For the duration, you have advantage on ability checks using that tool set.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fantastic Fighters.</em></strong> The hand splits into two hands, and will accept a weapon you give it, or will fight bare-knuckled. It will then spar with you or a willing creature you designate, using your Spell Attack Modifier. The hand will vanish after inflicting five hits (or a greater or lesser number that you specify), if it brings its sparring partner to 0 hit points, if it’s successfully disarmed, or if you or its sparring partner order it to vanish. If this damage would drop a creature to 0 hit points, the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and is knocked prone. It must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be knocked unconscious for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage or another creature uses its action to shake or slap it. The hand then returns to your side.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Feeling Fingers.</em></strong> The hand has a remarkable sense of touch. As an action, you can feel through the hand until the start of your next turn. During this time, you are numb. The hand can’t pick up or carry anything, but is capable of triggering traps, either by accident or on purpose.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Flying Fist.</em></strong> The hand flies to a creature of your choice you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the fist punches the target, inflicting 1d10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier bludgeoning damage. If this damage would drop a creature to 0 hit points, the creature instead drops to 1 hit point and is knocked prone. It must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be knocked unconscious for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage or another creature uses its action to shake or slap it. The hand then returns to your side.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Silencing Hand.</em></strong> The hand flies to a creature of your choice you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the hand clamps across the creature’s mouth. Unless the creature has another way of communicating, it can’t speak or cast spells that require verbal components until the hand is removed. Removing the hand requires a Strength (Athletics) check using your spell save DC. At your command (no action required by you), the hand releases the target, then returns to your side.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Strangling Grip.</em></strong> The hand flies to a creature of your choice you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the hand clamps across the creature’s throat. Until the hand is removed, the creature can’t breathe and is at risk of suffocating (as per <em>Player’s Handbook</em> chapter 8, Environment). Removing the hand requires a Strength (Athletics) check using your spell save DC. At your command (no action required by you), the hand releases the target, then returns to your side.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the flying fist inflicts an additional 1d10 damage for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

			<p>You must cast this spell at night, inside a circle you inscribe using the powdered silver and incense. You call upon the spirit of a deceased individual whose name you know, regardless of where the deceased’s body lies or how long it has been dead. There’s a chance you might get a different spirit anyway (DM’s choice), unless you also have an object belonging to the spirit.</p>
			<p class="indent">When the spirit appears, you can ask it up to ten questions, and it can take no other actions besides answering your questions. Unlike speak with dead, the spirit may have gained additional knowledge in the afterlife and isn’t limited to what it knew in life, and it’s also capable of speculation. The spirit will generally tell the truth as it understands it, but may decide to lie if you are hostile to it, if it recognizes you as an enemy, or if it is contrary or evil-minded. The DM will choose if and how it answers.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the spirit doesn’t know the answer to a question, you can order it to search the afterlife for the answer. If the question is not to its liking, or searching for the answer may be harmful to the spirit, it may attempt to refuse by making a Charisma saving throw. If the DM doesn’t know the spirit’s Charisma modifier, assume it’s +3. This search take 1d12 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">The spell lasts until you have asked all ten questions, you dismiss the spirit as a bonus action, or you cast this spell again. A dispel evil and good spell or similar magic will also banish the spirit, ending the spell early.</p>

			<p>Until this spell ends, you control vapor, fog, mist, and smoke inside an area you choose that fits inside a 30-foot cube. You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As a bonus action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You cause the vapor to move up to 30 feet in any direction.</li>
				<li>You cause the vapor to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction.</li>
				<li>You change the vapor’s color or opacity. You can cause the vapor to vanish completely, or to lightly or heavily obscure the area. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">If the vapor was caused by a spell, such as fog cloud, you must first succeed on a spellcasting ability check. The DC is equal to the original caster’s spell save DC. You don’t have to make a check if you created the fog.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the vapor is actually a creature, such as a vampiric mist, a vampire in mist form, or a creature in gaseous form, the creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a success, it isn’t altered. This spell does not inflict damage, and the creature can reverse any changes you make on its turn by using a bonus action.</p>

			<p>With this cruel spell, you curse a humanoid target with a form of indefinite madness, unless it succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw. The madness slowly grows over the course of 1d4 weeks. You have no control over the form the madness takes. The DM should either roll on the Indefinite Madness table in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em> (Chapter 8: Running the Game), or on the following table:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>d20</td><td>Madness</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1-2</td><td>“I feel that everything is strange and unnatural, like there’s something alien and sinister behind the façade. The people I thought of as friends may be part of it in some way.”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3-4</td><td>“I can’t remember large portions of my previous life, and I’m not sure I can trust what I do remember.”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>“It’s easiest when I don’t have to think. About anything.”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6-7</td><td>“Oh, look, faeries! Aww, aren’t they cute. Hi!”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8-10</td><td>“Oh my gods! That [type of creature, specific individual, or common everyday object] is terrifying! Don’t let it get me!”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>11</td><td>“I burst out in random bouts of laughter, crying, or screaming, and I just can’t help it.”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>12-13</td><td>“This [type of creature, specific individual, or common everyday object] is the most important thing in the world. I can’t let anyone take it away from me, or everything will be ruined!”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>14</td><td>“I have to kill them! It’s the only way to prove that I’m not crazy!”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>15-16</td><td>“There’s so much to do, and I’m the one to do it! I need to keep on doing this, and I couldn’t stop even if I wanted to.”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>17</td><td>“Where am I? This place is strange. What was I supposed to be doing again? Wait... You seem familiar. I know you, right?”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>18</td><td>“The people I thought were my friends are actually working against me. They’re keeping me here against my will and stopping me from doing what I need to do!”</td></tr>
				<tr><td>19-20</td><td>“Don’t look, but there are things following us. They’re hiding in the shadows, watching us. They’re everywhere!”</td></tr>

On a failure, the creature takes 3d10 necrotic damage and its hit point maximum is reduced by half that amount. The reduction lasts until the creature drinks at least a pint of water and takes a short rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

The quality of the art you produced is commensurate with your own artistic skill, but is still very rough. If you lose concentration before your drawing is complete, your drawing vanishes.</p>

The body is placed in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, it doesn’t age, and has resistance to all damage types. The mind itself drifts, undetectable except by truesight, unconscious, and immune to all damage. It occasionally “observes” events that it floats through, however.</p>
			<p class="indent">Casting this spell on the body a second time will restore the mind to the body, as will casting wish on it. The mind and body have to be on the same plane, however. The floating mind can also be captured in a magic jar, but it can’t possess another creature. A creature who is no longer disminded will remember the events its mind sometimes observed, but in a hazy, dreamlike way.</p>

			<p>You touch a beast, dragon, giant, humanoid, or monstrosity and transform one part of its body, shaping it as if it were clay. The creature must be incapacitated, restrained, or willing. You may also cast on a pregnant female or on an egg and affect the fetus instead.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you begin to cast this spell, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, whether it is willing or not. A willing creature has disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failure, you may shape the creature as you choose; otherwise, it’s unaffected. However, if the target’s rolls a 1 or lower on this save, then at the DM’s decretion, it also develops unwanted, potentially dangerous or detrimental, mutations.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each casting of the spell allows you to make one change. Examples of changes include, but aren’t limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changing one type of extremity (such as hands, hooves, or paws) to another type.</li>
				<li>Changing a quadrupedal stance to a bipedal stance (or vice versa).</li>
				<li>Altering jaws and vocal chords so the creature is capable of speech.</li>
				<li>Altering teeth and digestive track so the creature can eat a different type of diet.</li>
				<li>Giving or removing a natural attack, including the ability to inflict acid or poison damage, or the poisoned damage.</li>
				<li>Granting or removing darkvision, keen senses, or other natural traits, such as Amphibious or Sure-Footed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">You may not add or remove any magical or supernatural abilities, such as shapechanging, breath weapons, innate spellcasting, regeneration, or resistance or immunity to a type of damage or conditions.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25% chance for each casting after the first that the spell will backfire and the target takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage. If you cast this spell on a fetus, then any backfire will destroy the fetus.</p>
			<p class="indent">The DM will decide if the creature is capable of breeding true.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can add or remove magical abilities such as those described above; however, you can’t give the creature the ability to cast spells. You may also increase or decrease any attribute by one point.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast it with a 9th-level spell slot, you can give the creature the ability to cast a spell innately. You must have the spell written on a spell scroll. The spell scroll is consumed, whether this spell is successful or not.</p>

			<p class="indent">Your spirit can be detected with the <em>detect evil and good</em> spell, and you can’t enter an area protected by a magic circle or hallow. In addition, you can be targeted by spells such as <em>dispel evil and good</em>.

			<p>With this powerful spell, you transfer a large area of land to the Inner Plane dictated by the type of magic (such as a <em>bowl of commanding water elementals</em>) item you use as the material components. A sphere no larger than 40 miles in diameter centered on you then vanishes from the Prime Plane, leaving a hole in the ground behind, and ends up in the appropriate elemental plane or in the Elemental Chaos, as you desire.</p>
			<p class="indent">The sphere you transfer has a semi-permeable barrier. Creatures may enter through it, but nonliving elemental matter can’t. Air and water inside the barrier stay within and are renewed, kept at the same level of freshness as when you brought the sphere over, and the temperature remains the same as well.</p>
			<p class="indent">The material component used in the spell must remain at the center of the sphere, and cannot be used normally. If it is ever moved more than 5 feet from the center of the sphere, it crumbles to dust and the barrier vanishes, allowing elemental matter to flood in.</p>

			<p>You create a long whip of vivid purple light that lashes out at your command towards a creature in range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 6d6 force damage and is grappled and restrained (escape DC equal to your spell save DC) until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the creature breaks free of the grapple, or when the spell ends, the forcelash releases a powerful jolt of energy that causes the creature to convulse. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 3d6 force damage on a failed save and drops whatever anything it is carrying, or half as much damage on a successful save, and it doesn’t drop anything.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, you can pull the creature up to 15 feet closer to you (no action required).</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell with a 4th level or higher spell slot, the damage from the initial attack inflicts an additional 1d6 damage for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

			<p class="indent">For instance, if you roll a 7, and your target has four 1st level slots and four 2nd-level slots, you would drain all four 1st-level slots and one 2nd-level slot.</p>

			<p>You create an illusory audience that appears in a 30-foot cube centered on a point within range. The audience members represent a mix of sexes and races with which you are familiar, and they wear clothing of a type appropriate to the venue. Physical interaction with an audience member reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">Audience members are capable of making small talk, drawing on your own ability to do the same, but are incapable of answering questions about their own history or about current events. While you perform, they watch attentively and respond with appropriate applause, laughter, murmurs of appreciation, or even heckling, if you wish them to. If you prefer, they will be completely silent.</p>

Both creatures must be within range and make a Constitution saving throw. If the creatures are of two different types (i.e., one is a beast and the other is a humanoid) or are of two different size categories, they have advantage on their saving throw. Unconscious creatures have disadvantage on their saves. Creatures with a positive Intelligence modifier may add that modifier to their rolls. If one or both succeed, the spell fails.</p>
			<p class="indent">If both creatures fail their saving throws, they are merged into a single creature. However, if one or both creatures failed by 5 or more, the creature also takes 3d6 force damage. If this is enough to reduce the creature to 0 hit points, the spell fails.</p>
			<p class="indent">The new creature will have no more than one or two traits and one or two attacks from each of its “parents.” You may attempt to determine which traits you wish to keep by make an Intelligence (Arcana) check, using your spell save DC. Its attributes, size, and hit dice, are an average of its “parents’” attributes. If both of its “parents” are resistant or immune to a damage type or condition, it retains that resistance or immunity. If only one “parent” is, the DM will decide if it keeps that resistance or immunity.</p>

				<tr><td>6-9</td><td><strong><em>Dominance.</em></strong> The creature looks like one of the parents with a few features of the other. Likewise, its personality and alignment will be primarily like that of one parent (not necessarily the one it most looks like) with elements of the other’s personality.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>10-11</td><td><strong><em>Mixed.</em></strong> The creature looks the two creatures were glued together in some way. It might look centauric, with part of one parent’s body attached to parts of the other’s, or it might look like a perfect amalgam of the two parents but with two heads, one from each parent, or it might have a completely different blend of features.

			<p>You touch a creature other than a construct or undead and steal some of its life force. Make a melee spell attack. On a success, the creature takes 6d8 necrotic damage and you hold its life force in your hand, where it takes the form of a glowing, silvery-gray orb. On a subsequent turn, you may then touch a different creature (which may be yourself). That creature gains temporary hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage. If the damage you inflicted on the first creature brought it to 0 hit points, any excess damage is lost and not given to the second creature as temporary hit points. If you don’t give the life force to another creature by the time the spell ends, the orb vanishes and the life force is lost.</p>

You can then use your action to see through the magic eye until the start of your next turn, for up to 1 minute. During this time, you are blind with regard to your own senses. At the end of that time, the eye vanishes from view. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it pings you and you look through it, or it can remain and reappear whenever the trigger occurs.</p>
			<p class="indent">The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual conditions that occur within 30 feet of the object.

If the check succeeds, the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion and the spell will end for it, but not for other affected creatures, who will see the target vanish in a way appropriate for the phantasm. For instance, if the target realizes a phantasm of a ferocious monster is an illusion and is no longer affected by it, the other creatures who are still affected might see the target get killed.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the targets are affected by the spell, they treat the phantasm as if it were real. They rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm.

			<p class="indent">When that circumstance occurs, the writing appears and glows faintly. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end and the words remain visible after they are triggered (in which case, the glow will fade over the course of an hour, leaving normal text behind), or it can remain and become visible again whenever the trigger occurs (in which case, the words will remain visible for 10 minutes after the trigger occurs).</p>
			<p class="indent">The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visible or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the text. For example, you could instruct the words to appear when any elf touches the page, or when the page is exposed to the moonlight of the winter solstice.</p>

In addition, you can create a small, obvious illusion that will relay a message to you of up to 20 words. This illusion will play at the same time you receive the ping.</p>

			<p>You cause a portal to open up on another plane of existence, or to another world on the Prime. The plane’s runic symbols must be drawn in a circle or around a door, window, or other arch using the rare inks. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the realm of Mycelia in Mechanus, and the portal will appear in or near that destination.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you create the portal, you can specify a key needed to use it. The key can be an object or password. When the key is used, the portal will open for 1 minute, then close again. A forked, metal rod attuned to that plane of existence or other world, like the one used as a material component, can also be used to open the portal.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you cast this spell on the same arch every 10 days for a year, the portal becomes permanent.</p>

			<p>You create a quasi-real illusion of an object, creature, or other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The illusion appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. The spectral force has appearance, sound, smell, temperature, and texture that is <em>mostly</em> appropriate to the thing depicted, but inspection will quickly reveal that it’s an illusion, without the need for an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Realizing it’s an illusion doesn’t cause the viewer to see through the image.</p>
			<p class="indent">The illusion is partially solid. It can’t support more than 50 pounds of weight at a time. If made to support more, the object it is supporting will sink through. It has AC 15 and hit points equal to 10 plus your spellcasting ability modifier plus your level.</p>
			<p class="indent">As long as you are within range of the spectral force, you can use your action to cause it to move to any other spot within range. As the spectral force changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can also use your action to cause the spectral force to inflict damage. A spectral force creature to appear as a creature can attack a target; one created to look like a fire can burn the target, and so on. It uses your spell attack modifier to hit and inflicts 1d6 force damage.</p>

The first item must be “permanent” (i.e., not a consumable or limited-use item such as a potion or magical dust).

For instance, you could take the enchantment from a sword of wounding and place it in a longbow, turning it into a longbow of wounding.</p>

On a failure, the transfer fails to work and the second item can’t be used with this spell again. If the check fails by 5 or more, the enchantment on the first item is lost, rendering it permanently nonmagical.</p>

			<p>This spell enables you to speak with the voice of a storm. You can be heard loudly and clearly by all creatures within 300 feet. In addition, creatures within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute on a failed save. On a failed save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. If a creature fails its save by 5 or more, it is also knocked prone. A deafened creature may attempt a new save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

			<p>A wall of thin, misty, silvery smoke—the visible form of Time itself—springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall slows down everything that passes through it. If a creature travels through the wall, its speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions until the end of its turn. Any ranged attack that enters the wall’s space has disadvantage on the attack roll and inflicts half damage. Any effect that passes through the wall that requires the targets to make a Dexterity saving throw, that saving throw may be made with advantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wall is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate or spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Planes, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>

			<p>You create a time loop in a creature’s mind, causing it to repeat its actions indefinitely. At the start of each of its turns, it may attempt a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it performs the same action, bonus action, and reaction (or lack thereof) it did on its previous turn, even if the action’s target isn’t available. For instance, if the creature made an attack, it will make the same attack, even if there is nobody around for it to attack or a different creature (even an ally) is placed in front of it. If it cast a spell, it will go through the same actions required for that particualr spell, even if it lacks components or spell slots. If it drank a potion, it will drink from the same vial, even if the vial is empty. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, the spell immediately ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">While this spell is in effect, the creature’s speed is 0 feet.</p>

			<p>When you cast this spell, you create an area of thick mist in a cylinder 20 feet high and 120 feet wide. The area is heavily obscured and is difficult terrain. Nonmagical lights brought into the area shed light to half their normal radius. Creatures have disadvantage on any roll made to navigate through the area.</p>
			<p class="indent">Should a Small or larger creature that is not an aberration, construct, fiend, or undead enter this area, a portion of the mist will coagulate and form into a zombie, which will attempt to attack the intruder. The fog will create a new zombie each turn on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties). The zombies will not leave the area of mist, can’t be turned, and will dissipate back into mist when dropped to 0 hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you cast this spell, you may name any number of creatures who can pass through its area unhindered. To such a creature, the area will be dimly lit normal terrain, and no zombies will form to attack it. Constructs and undead are also not hindered when passing through the area.</p>
			<p class="indent">The whole wardmisted area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast will remove the mist from a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the point you chose.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can create a permanently wardmisted area by casting this spell in the area every day for one year.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the mist forms into ghouls instead.</p>

			<p>You target an object, or section of a larger object, that weighs no more than 50 pounds and is made of nonmagical metal, stone, or plant material, and make a twisting motion with your hands. At the same time, the material itself is warped and twisted into uselessness.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the object is protected by magic but not in itself magical (e.g., a door on which arcane lock or glyph of warding has been cast) you must first make on an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, you are able to warp the object. The magical protection remains in place, however.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the weight of the object that you can affect increases by 50 pounds for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

			<p>This spell allows you to sense the presence of and location to gates and portals to other planes of existence, provided that there is one within 1,000 feet of you.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once such a portal is detected, you can spend an action concentrating on it and making a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to determine where the portal leads or if a key is required to use the portal. If you can see the portal in operation, you have advantage on that check.</p>

			<p>This spell maintains the weather conditions in a 100-foot cube, keeping them exactly as they were when you first cast the spell. Any change of weather or temperature, including that created by the control weather spell that occurs on outside the cube doesn’t affect the interior of the cube. However, a creature that is within the spell’s area can’t cast control weather or use a similar magical effect while within it.</p>

			<p>You touch a wood object of Medium size or smaller or a section of wood or other plant material no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a log into a chair, a chest, or a bookcase, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a wood door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible. You can’t use this spell on a living tree.</p>
