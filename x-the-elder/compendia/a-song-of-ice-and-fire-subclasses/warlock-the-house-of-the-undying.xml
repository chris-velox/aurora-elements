        <description>
            <p>Your patron is House of Undying, the most powerful order of warlocks. The House of the Undying resides in Qarth and is an ancient building situated amongst a grove of black-barked trees with inky blue leaves which are used to make shade-of-the-evening, the drink that grants the Undying One warlocks their power and has turned their lips blue over time. Some might mock your patron as a once powerful sect now crumbling in decay, but if said before a warlock their jibes would scarce leave their mouth before their own death rattle.</p>

                <p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a realm showing a series enigmatic visions, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.</p>
