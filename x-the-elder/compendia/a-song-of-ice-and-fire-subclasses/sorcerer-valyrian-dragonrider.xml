        <description>
            <p>Before the Doom, the Valyrian skies were filled with dragonlords atop their dragon mounts. But much has changed since, and such sights are all but lost throughout the world. Yet, the rare unity of dragon and rider can exist.</p>
            <p class="indent">None can tame a dragon unless some the magic of Old Valyria runs in their blood. Of course, this lineage has been known to crop up in the most unexpected people. But this bloodline is no guarantee of successfully bonding with a dragon. Dragons do not merely submit to anyone with the magic inside them. It takes a strong personality, the ability to foster trust and respect, and time to bend such creatures to one’s will. However, once formed this connection between a dragon and dragonrider is absolute; the dragon will not accept another master while its previous rider lives.</p>

You can use the dragon as a mount if you are size Medium or smaller and are not exceeding your carrying capacity. While mounted, you can have your dragon take all the normal actions a mount can take (see Mounted Combat pg. 198 of the Player’s Handbook). Otherwise, you must use your action to command your dragon to take any actions, and some actions cost sorcery points to use as noted in the Dragon Taming table. Some of the options on the Dragon Taming table won’t be available to use until your dragon grows and gains those actions. Your dragon can not act independently, even if you are not mounted.</p>
