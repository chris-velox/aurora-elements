            <p>The Citadel is where maesters -- the scholars in service to the nobility and people of Westeros -- are trained. You can find boys and men of low and high birth status from all over the Seven Kingdoms studying at the Citadel, and though the Citadel would never admit it, you may find some girls and women who have disguised themselves in order to seek knowledge there.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a student has mastered a subject to the satisfaction of an archmaester, he is awarded a link of a metal representing knowledge of that subject. With more links he begins to form his maester’s chain. Most who start their studies won’t complete their chain, either growing aged as they continue their study or simply leaving to pursue other aspects of the world. Your leaving may have something to do with the magic you have managed to learn. Viewed as a force lost since the end of Valyria or a myth that never really existed, magic is wholly suppressed by almost all the archmaesters of the Citadel.</p>

                <p>When you join the College of the Citadel at 3rd level, you begin to forge a maester’s chain, a symbol of both the knowledge you’ve mastered and that you serve not yourself but all of Westeros. Pick two skills to gain proficiency with from Animal Handling, Arcana, History, Medicine, Religion, or Nature. You pick one additional proficiency to gain from this list at 6th level and 14th level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Each proficiency has a corresponding spell you may cast as a ritual (as described in chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook) while you posses your maester’s chain.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, you begin your life of service to others. When you grant a friendly creature one of your Bardic Inspirations, the target also benefits from the Help action. If you aid an ally in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be within 30 feet of you, rather than within 5 feet of you.</p>

                <p>When you reach 6th level, you have developed ways to hide or end magic akin to the Citadel’s censorship. You learn the <em>counterspell</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>, and <em>Nystul’s magic aura</em> spells. These spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.</p>

                <p>Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roil the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you whether you succeed or fail.</p>
