            <p>The ironborn were made by the Drowned God to dominate the waters of the earth through reaving, raping, and seeking glory in blood and song. He will not suffer cowards but has given every brave man "a gift", something in which he excels.</p>
            <p class="indent">While all true ironborn worship the Drowned God, his priests and clerics wear mottled robes of green, grey, and blue and braid dried seaweed through their long hair and untrimmed beard. Clerics will drink sea water from time to time, and some eat only fish and bathe only in sea water. These clerics perform a baptism of salt water to symbolically drown a person as a means to give themselves to the Drowned God. Some clerics actually drown the disciple and then bring them back to life, using the "kiss of life". Not everyone is successfully revived, however.</p>
