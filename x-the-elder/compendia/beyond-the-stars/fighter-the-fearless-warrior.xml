            <p>Valiant heroes, warriors defying overwehelming odds against the tides of darkness, shouting in defiance against the horrors of the Far. Fearless Warriors are heroes whose hearts are emboldened with such courage and bravery that they do not balk or hesitate, no matter how frightening the forces they face.

            <description>
                <p>At 3rd level, you know how to press the advantage of combat, pushing yourself onward and delivering devastating blows to your enemies. Once per turn, when you make a weapon attack, you can choose to make that attack a Heroic Strike, so long as you have advantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, you deal the attack’s weapon damage, plus an extra amount equal to your Fighter level. In addition, if the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this special attack, you gain advantage on your next melee or ranged weapon at tack you make before the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength or Dexterity Modifier, whichever is higher (minimum of once). You regain expended uses of this feature after a long rest.</p>

                <p>Upon reaching 7th level, you can let out a piercing battle cry that rattles the hearts of your enemies, but rallies those of your allies (no action required). You and each ally that can see or hear you within 60 feet of you gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Fighter level + your Charisma Modifier, as long as a creature has these temporary hit points, they have advantage on saving throws against the frightened condition.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, if any ally is currently frightened they can immediately repeat their saving throw against that effect. Each enemy within range that can see or hear you must make a Charisma Saving Throw (DC = 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Charisma Modifier) or be frightened of you for 1 minute. They can repeat their save at the end of each turn, ending it on a successful save. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after a short or long rest.</p>

                <p>Starting at 15th level, your defiant spirit can keep you fighting despite the most grievous of wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points and don’t die outright, you can make a DC:10 Constitution Saving Throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>

You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical weapons. In addition, when you take damage from any source, you can use your reaction to fight against the pain and shrug it off, reducing the damage taken by an amount equal to your Fighter level.
