            <p>You heal more quickly than normal and regain 1d4 hit points when you manifest this power, up to a maximum amount equal to the damage you received within the last round. You stop bleeding when you manifest this power and don’t lose hit points from blood loss or bleeding while this power remains in effect as your wounds close rapidly.</p>

            <p>When confronted with conditions outside the norm, your body adapts to these conditions. While this power is in effect, you don’t suffer the effects of extreme temperatures (though you still take cold or fire damage).</p>
            <p class="indent">The effects of this power last until the end of your next turn unless you choose to maintain the power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You gain the ability to perceive the world using one of your other senses, such as feeling light, or seeing sound. Through this function, you can counteract blindness or deafness by changing how you perceive the sensory stimulus, by hearing or feeling light in the case of blindness or feeling or seeing sound in the case of deafness.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the time of manifestation, you select one sense (sight, hearing, taste, smell, or touch) and one additional way you can perceive it that would normally fall under one of the five senses. For instance you could choose to see taste to determine what contents are in vial, or you could feel sight and be able to see normally without opening your eyes (thus avoiding meeting the gaze of a creature).</p>
            <p class="indent">Illusion effects, including blur and invisibility, will still confuse your synesthete senses as they would your normal senses.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 0 power points when you take no other augmentation except increasing the maintenance time to manifest this power using a bonus action and without requiring a trigger condition.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> Increase the maintenance time to 10 minutes.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to increase the maintenance time to 1 hour by spending an additional 3 power points (5). You can further empower it by spending 4 more power points (9) to increase the maintenance to 24 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> When you take damage from any source, you gain damage resistance to that damage type. On successive rounds while this power is in effect, you can use your reaction again against another damage source. When you do so, you must choose which resistance to maintain.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 8 power points (11) to gain immunity instead of resistance if you maintain resistance for at least 3 rounds. If you use your reaction to gain resistance to another damage type and choose to maintain the new damage resistance, you lose immunity until maintaining the new resistance for at least 3 rounds.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Your body adapts to survive hostile environments, including underwater or even airless locations. You don’t need to state which adaptations you take on, it happens automatically. You can breathe anywhere and can’t suffocate. You are also immune to the poisoned condition. Environmental hazards such as lava and acidic clouds only deal half damage, but spells, powers, and abilities deal normal damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> Your body gains extreme resilience to conditions. When you are afflicted by the blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned conditions, you automatically remove the condition at the start of your next turn and can’t suffer that condition again while this power remains in effect.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture</p>
            <p>You can increase the intensity of lightning, create sparks, or manipulate electrical currents within a field covering a 10-foot cube. When you manifest this power you can choose to have electricity amplified, diminished, or redirected within the cube. This power remains in effect until the start of your next turn when it is no longer maintained.</p>
            <p class="indent">An amplified electricity field causes lightning damage dealt to targets within it to deal an additional 1 lightning damage per die. Additionally, each creature that begins its turn within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. If this save is failed, it takes 1 lightning damage. If the creature suffered lightning damage within the previous round, it makes this save with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">A diminish electricity field grants each creature within the cube advantage on saving throws against lightning damage. Attack rolls for attacks that deal lightning damage made against each creature within the field are made with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you redirect electricity, you may use your reaction whenever a lightning damaging effect passes through, originates within, or targets inside your field. You make a ranged power attack against an AC equal to the spell or power save DC of the originator. If successful, you can pick one 5-foot section within your cube to be affected. A creature within that space takes the normal effects of the lightning source. Any creature within a different space of your field is unaffected.</p>
            <p class="indent">During your turn, you may take a bonus action to change the type of field. Each augmentation that affect a specific field type is suppressed while the field is of a different type, but resume when the field is switched back.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Increase your amplified field’s damage by 1 point. You can take this augmentation multiple times. For every 3 power points spent this way, the lightning damage from other sources deal an additional 1 damage per die against targets within the field.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> You can use your action to move your field up to 30 feet on your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> You can use your redirection field to instead spread lightning effects to each space within your field. You must decide whether to redirect or spread when you first manifest this power and at the start of each of you turns while it remains in effect. If the lightning effect comes from an ally, you automatically succeed your ranged power attack.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> Increase the dimensions of your field by 10 feet. You can take this augmentation multiple times up to 12 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Each creature within your diminished field gains damage resistance to lightning. Additionally, if it passes its Dexterity saving throw to reduce lightning damage, it instead takes no damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this effect to grant creatures within your diminishing field immunity to lightning by spending an additional 8 power points (13).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Using your reaction, you can trap any electrical effect that passes through, originates from, or targets a space within your field. A trapped lightning spell, power, or ability has no effect. During your next turn, you can use your action to produce the effect against a target within 30 feet of your field. Damage and effects are identical to the original source, but use your power attack or power save DC. If you don’t use your action to use the trapped effect, it dissipates.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You can use your action to cause your field to fire a spark of electricity up to 30 feet away. Make a range power attack against a target, which if it hits deals 4d8 + 8 lighting damage. Each creature within 5 feet of your target must make a Dexterity saving through. If the save is failed, it takes 2d8 + 4 lightning damage. If the save is successful, it takes half the damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, increasing the damage by 2d8 on the direct attack and 1d8 on the area of effect for every 3 additional power points you spend to a maximum of 9 points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> Your diminishing field will harm creatures composed of electricity. Each such creature within the field when you manifest or move it, which begins its turn within the field, or that enters or reenters the field must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature takes 8d12 necrotic damage. If successful, the creature takes no damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> You can use your action to transform your field into a static elemental golem under your control or to transform the golem back into the field.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to direct the golem. Until otherwise ordered, the golem will repeat your last direction if able. If unable and you don’t direct the golem, it will hover in place and take no action, but it will defend itself if attacked.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your golem’s hit points persist between states. Any lightning damage dealt inside a redirected field can be redirected to heal the golem for an amount equal to the damage dealt.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use the golem to trap electrical effects if you manifested this power with that augmentation as if it were the field.</p>

            <p>This power enables you to modify the memories of a creature. Alterations are generally temporary, but can be augmented to be permanent. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw, and if you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. If the save is successful, the power fails and can’t be maintained.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can suppress the memory of a creature of a single recent event, such as your presence or a task it was given. If the creature fails its saving through, it can’t recall the event so long as the power remains in effect. The event can have occurred no longer than 1 minute prior to manifesting this power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You can affect longer blocks of memory or more distant memories. You can affect memories up to 1 hour ago and up to 1 minute long.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 3 power points (4) to affect memories up to 24 hours ago and up to 10 minutes long. By spending an additional 4 power points (8) you can affect memories up to 1 year old and 1 hour long. For 4 more power points (12) you can affect any memory and alter up to 24 hours of memories.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> You can target one additional creature, provided it is within range. You can take this augmentation multiple times up to 10 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can suppress memory of a single tool, skill, or weapon proficiency on a creature. A natural weapon is a valid proficiency for purposes of this power. An affected creature can’t add its proficiency bonus to die rolls of the suppressed proficiency while this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> The power lingers for 1 hour per round you maintained this power. After each hour, the creature makes a new Intelligence saving throw to break free of the memory alteration.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to increase the time it will linger by 1 hour per round of maintenance for each additional power point you spend this way.</p>
            <p class="indent">Alternately, you can spend an additional 8 power points (12) to empower this augmentation to be permanent until removed through Psychic Chirurgery, greater restoration, or dispel evil and good.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You can replace the memory of a creature or insert a memory into it. The memory can be no longer than one minute, and replaces only the most recent minute.</p>
            <p class="indent">If contradictory information clashes with the modified memory, the target makes a new Intelligence saving throw. If successful, the altered or added memory is removed or the lost memory is restored.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>15.</i></b> Mental tendrils wrap around a creature’s mind when you manifest this power, ripping away its memory of the past minute and every passing moment. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is dazed and unable to take actions or reactions while this power remains in effect. At the end of each of its turns, it makes a new saving throw. If successful, the power’s effects end on it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature can’t concentrate if affected by this power, and loses any effect or ability that requires concentration.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Visual (overt)</p>
            <p>You create a spectral crossbow (or similar device that can make ranged attacks) which fires gooey ectoplasm. You can direct it to move and attack by taking a bonus action. If the construct hits a creature, the creature’s next attack is made with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The crossbow is a Tiny construct that has AC 13, 10 hit points, a flight speed of 20 feet, hovers, and damage resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. The crossbow automatically generates ectoplasm bolts without the need to reload. It has the range of a hand crossbow (30/120).</p>
            <p class="indent">Attacks made by an astral construct or shambler count as from a magical weapon and use your power attack modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> When you reach 5th level, your astral construct gains 20 hit points (30), 20 more hit points at 11th level (50), and once more at 17th level (70).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Your construct’s bolts deal 1d4 + you manifester ability bonus force damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, increasing the force damage by 1d4 per 4 additional power points spent.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> Increase your construct’s range to that of a heavy crossbow (100/400).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> Increase the area of effect of your bolts by a 5-foot radius. You must take an augmentation that adds an area of effect to take this augmentation. You can take this augmentation multiple times up to 15 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Your construct’s bolts explode into twisted webs made of hardened ectoplasm in a 5-foot radius. Each creature caught in this area must make a Strength saving throw. If this save is failed, the creature is restrained so long as this power remains in effect. At the end of each of the creature’s turns it makes a new saving throw to escape the web. If a creature escapes the web, it has its movement speed halved for one minute, until this power ends, or until it (or an ally) uses its action to remove the ectoplasm.</p>
            <p class="indent">Ectoplasm webs can be attacked. Each 5-foot section has AC 10, 40 hit points, and damage immunity to blunt, cold, piercing, poison, psychic, and thunder.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Your construct’s bolts explode. Instead of making a ranged power attack roll, your construct strikes a 5-foot radius sphere. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is failed, it takes whatever effects your construct delivers. If the save is successful, it doesn’t suffer disadvantage from the bolt and damage, if any, is halved.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> A creature of Large size or smaller hit by an ectoplasm bolt must make a Strength saving throw. If the save is failed, it is pushed 10 feet away from the construct. When pairing this augmentation with the web augmentation, the webs will snare the target in its new space if it fails its saving throw against the ectoplasm webs.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> When you use your astral construct’s attack, you can take a reaction to create an astral shambler in a space adjacent to the target. The astral shambler acts on its own initiative and will attack the nearest creature. You can only create one shambler per manifester ability bonus you have (minimum 1). During your turn, you can dismiss each astral shambler you choose created by this power.</p>

            <p>You can control and manipulate blood. You must have a source of exposed blood to use this power. You can trivially cut yourself to use this power when you manifest it, using your own space as the point of origin. If a creature is called to make a Constitution saving throw, it only makes one save and applies the result to each effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you first manifest this power, and by using your action while this power remains in effect, you can lash any target within 10 feet of the blood source by making a melee power attack. If you hit, you deal 1d6 + you manifesting ability modifier slashing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level, you deal an additional 1d6 slashing damage (2d6) with the blood lash. At 11th level this damage improves by another 1d6 (3d6), and once again at 17th level (4d6).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> When you hit a creature with a blood lash, it must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed it takes an additional 1d6 damage from blood loss, provided it can bleed.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, increasing the damage by 1d6 for every additional 3 power points you spend up to a maximum of 9 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> When you hit with a blood lash, it becomes a tendril that grapples a Medium or smaller target, restraining it. A blood tendril can be attacked, has AC 13, 18 hit points, and immunity to bludgeoning, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. As long as this power is in effect, a creature grappled by the tendril automatically takes damage from your blood tendril at the end of your turn. An affected creature can use its action to break free of the tendril by making a Strength check against a DC 13.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you attack a different target, the existing tendril collapses into blood and the creature is immediately freed.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to affect a Large creature by spending an additional 4 power points (9).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Your blood lash causes a creature’s blood to erupt internally. A creature hit by your blood lash also must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, it is stunned until the end of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You siphon the blood from a creature hit by your blood lash to another willing creature within 10 feet of your blood lash’s source. The creature recovers one half the damage your lash deals plus one half of any damage from blood loss. Any healing beyond a creature’s maximum hit points is converted into a shield of blood that grants it temporary hit points equal to the excess amount that lasts until the end of its next turn when the blood collapses to the ground.</p>

            <p>You can manipulate light in up to four 10-foot cubes. A light source must exist before this power can be used, and this power can’t use light it generates to power itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can make dim light into bright light or bright light into dim light.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level, you control an additional two cubes (6 cubes). At 11th level you control another two cubes (eight), and once again at 17th level (10 cubes).</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You can suppress light in the area making it one step darker (bright light to dim light, dim light to darkness). The source of the light isn’t destroyed when making dim light into darkness; it just appears to give off no light.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this power remains in effect, you can decrease the intensity of the light by an additional step by using your action on successive turns. For instance, if light is cast within your effect area, you can diminish the light to dim light on your next turn, and then to darkness on the following turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> Bright light flashes into blinding light in each 5-foot cube of light within your area you choose. Each creature within an affected cube must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. Dim light you make bright through this power can be used.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use your action to cause light to again flash blindingly in each 5-foot cube you choose while this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Twisting existing light, you are able to bend and move light from one location to another. You can reshape light you control into any shape so long as it is contiguous, within range of the power, and touching at least one light source.

            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> You intensify bright light into the equivalent of sunlight. Creatures with sunlight vulnerabilities are affected as if under broad daylight. Dim light you make bright through this power can be used.</p>

While this power remains in effect, you can use your action to cause the sunlight to burst in up to three 10-foot cubes you choose. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d6 radiant damage and is blinded for one minute. If the save is successful, the creature takes half damage and is not blinded. Undead and oozes make this saving throw with disadvantage. A blinded creature makes a new Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turn. If it succeeds on this save, the creature is no longer blinded.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture</p>
            <p>You penetrate the boundaries between the planes, liberating you from the restrictions of the Material Plane.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can open a small pocket dimension to secret handheld items weighing no more than 10 pounds away. You have a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Sleight of Hands) checks to hide such an item.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You expand your pocket dimension into a space identical to a bag of holding. The opening moves with you for as long as this power is in effect. The contents of the dimensional space spill out all around you when this power ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> Increase the maintenance time by 1 hour. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You use your dimensional pocket to temporarily shift you into a transitive state between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell. When you move, you can ignore any movement impediments short of a solid barrier, such as a wall. You are immune to the restrained condition, and if you are already restrained, you are immediately freed when manifesting this power. You don’t trigger opportunity attacks when you take your movement.</p>
            <p class="indent">You are still affected by hazards that don’t restrict movement such as fire, and you can still be attacked normally. If you aren’t on the Material Plane when you manifest this power, it fails.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You use your pocket dimension to shift to the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain there for as long as you maintain this power. During this time you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything looks gray, and you can’t see more than 60 feet away.</p>
            <p class="indent">While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special ability, spell, or power has given them the ability to do so.</p>
            <p class="indent">You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you originated from.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the power ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same space as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately moved to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy.</p>
            <p class="indent">This power has no effect if you manifest it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer Planes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> Through your pocket dimension, you project your astral body into the Astral Plane. The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principle difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisible after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as it remains intact, you can find your way home. If your cord is cut, you must make a Wisdom (Insight) check against a DC 15. If this check fails, you die instantly, your body and soul separated. If this check succeeds, you wake up in your body having successfully traced your mind and body.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when you manifested this power, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. Your astral form can maintain powers on its own while your body maintains this power. Additionally, while in your astral form, you body doesn’t suffer psychic strain from powers your astral form manifests, but your astral form will.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you end this power, you awaken in your physical body. If your body or astral form drops to 0 hit points, the power immediately ends. It can also end when subjected to psychic static or dispel magic, and Psychic Chirurgery can extract you from the Astral Plane.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are already on the Astral Plane when you manifest this power, it will fail.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>17.</i></b> You expand your pocket dimension into a demiplane that is very small and minor. This demiplane is a reflection of your mind and you can determine the terrain and features of it, up to a 300-foot radius sphere. You can’t create life, but can create the appearance of plants through sculpted ectoplasm.</p>
            <p class="indent">You demiplane exists on the Astral Plane and connects to the Astral Plane and the plane you manifested this power from. You, and anyone you allow, can travel between these two planes using your demiplane. You can also attempt to force a creature into your demiplane by succeeding a grapple and using a bonus action. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature is shunted into your demiplane.</p>
            <p class="indent">While on your demiplane, you can take lair actions. You can alter your demiplane’s features, use it to manifest any power you know without expending your own power points, or attempt to imprison one creature. When changing features, you can move ground and object mass up to 50 feet in an instant or reshape up to a 50-foot cube of structures. If you attempt to imprison a creature, it must make a Charisma saving throw or become trapped within the demiplane as if under the effect of the imprisonment spell. You can only imprison one creature at a time. If you attempt to imprison another creature, the former creature is freed. Imprisoned creatures are able to freely move and act within your demiplane, but spells, powers, and effects that allow movement between planes used by the imprisoned creature will fail.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once this power ends, you can no longer access your demiplane until you manifest this power again. The demiplane remains in existence while not maintained and can be found in the Astral Plane, but all entrances and exits to it are sealed, and a traveler must possess means, such as plane shift, to enter it.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture, Visual (glow)</p>
            <p>Refashioning space and time, you create a temporary dimensional fold that moves yourself, an object weighing no more than 400 lbs., or a Large size or smaller creature to another location.</p>
            <p class="indent">You move your target 5 feet in any direction. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If this save succeeds it is not moved (when attempting to relocate multiple creatures, if one creature makes its saving throw, no creatures are moved).</p>
            <p class="indent">When you augment this power, any augmentation effects replaces this function of the power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level, the range of this power increases to 30 feet. At 11th level, the range increases to 60 feet. At 17th level the range increases to 100 feet.</p>

            <p class="indent">This augmentation can be empowered to affect an unwilling creature within range by spending an additional 4 power points (5). The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature swaps position with your other target.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You affect one additional creature. Each creature affected must be in range and within 30 feet of each other. You can take this augmentation multiple times up to 12 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>6.</i></b> You can affect a creature of Huge size or smaller or an object weighing no more than 800 lbs.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to affect a creature of any size or an object weighing up to 1 ton by spending an additional 6 power points (12).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You attempt to disrupt a creature’s temporal location. If the creature fails its Dexterity saving throw, it becomes translucent and semi-tangible. For 1 minute, it deals and takes only half damage, regains only half any restored hit points, and can’t make reactions or take bonus actions. Its movement rate is halved and appears to happen in flashes, and it can only perceive up to 60 feet with any senses it possesses. It is also immune to the grappled condition.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (11) to increase the duration to 10 minutes. By spending another 4 points (15), you can further increase the duration to 1 hour.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> You send a creature 1 minute into the future. For the creature, no time passes at all. After the minute passes, the creature returns to the same spot it was before, dislodging anything occupying its space to the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (17) to send it forward in time 1 hour.</p>

            <p>You exert will over the destiny of a creature in range. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, which if successful, stops the power from affecting it.</p>
            <p class="indent">You cause a creature to make its first attack roll on its next turn with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> A creature with disadvantage on an attack roll treats each roll above 15 as 15 until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> A creature affected by this power is shown countless images of possible outcomes and suffers disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> You affect one additional creature. You can take this augmentation multiple times up to 16 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You cause the subject to repeat the action it took during its previous turn on its next turn. If it targeted another creature, object, or space, it will attempt to attack or aid that same target. For example, if a giant hurled a boulder at a square 40 feet away, it will throw another stone at that same space.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target will consume any resource, including a bonus action, which it used when making the previous action. If the situation has changed in a way that the subject can’t take the same action, it instead takes no action. The creature can still move and use reactions as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once a creature has repeated its action the power’s effect ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> A creature failing its saving throw is crippled by images of countless outcomes and is unable to take actions or bonus actions during its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You link the fate of two creatures in range to each other for 1 minute, provided each creature is within 30 feet of the other. At least two creatures must fail their Wisdom saving throws for this power to have effect. Whenever once creature is afflicted with the blinded, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, or unconscious condition, the linked creature is also affected for the same duration. If a creature is knocked unconscious from damage, the unconscious condition is not shared to a linked creature. Other effects that cause disadvantage or impose penalties on attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws are also shared with the linked creature. If a condition or effect is removed from one creature, it is removed from each linked creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 6 power points (15). If a creature takes damage, each linked creature takes the same damage. If the damaged creature is immune to the damage type inflicted, each linked creature takes no damage from this power. If a creature dies, each linked creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your power save DC. If this save is failed, the creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage. On a success it takes half the damage.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture</p>
            <p>You are able to perceive and affect the dream realm. Subjects must be within 5 feet of you for you to focus on their dreams or enter them. While you view or enter a dream, your body is incapacitated.</p>
            <p class="indent">While maintaining this power, you can use your action to focus on a sleeping creature and see the dream it is experiencing. You can only use this power on a creature once per 24-hour period.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> When you focus on a creature for at least 1 hour, you can attempt to guide its dream in a way to reveal one fact the creature knows, including one which the creature is not aware it knows, such as a suppressed memory. An unwilling creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the save succeeds, its dream reveals nothing to you. When the creature awakens, it will become aware of this fact if it wasn’t already aware of it before.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can focus on subsequent hours to learn additional facts or attempt to uncover the same one as a previous probe. If the dreamer has succeeded one saving throw against this power, it makes each subsequent saving throw against you at advantage for the remainder of its slumber.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> If a creature, spell, power, or other effect is affecting the dream of a sleeping creature you are focused on, you are aware of the type of the creature or effect and have a general idea of how powerful it is.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You can use your action to leave your body and enter the dream of another sleeping creature on which you set your focus. While in the dream, you can use any clairsentient or telepathic powers on the subject or within the confines of the dream. If a hostile creature is within the subject’s dream, you can direct your clairsentient and telepathic powers against it.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (9). Doing so enables you to act as a dream architect within the subject’s dream, but you can’t enter an adjacent dream or travel outside the Dreamscape.</p>
            7.* If you spend one hour focused upon or within the dream of a nearby sleeping creature, you can alter its dream. You can grant the target an inspiring dream that grants the creature inspiration for 24 hours or until used. This instance of inspiration can’t be given away. If the creature is a player character that already has inspiration, this power has no effect.
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> If you spend one hour focused upon or within the dream of a nearby sleeping creature, you can alter its dream. You can grant the target a relieving dream that grants the creature peaceful rest. The creature loses one level of exhaustion, and suffers no nightmares or ill effects from spells, powers, or abilities that affect dreams for the duration of the sleep to a maximum of 8 hours of rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> If you spend one hour focused upon or within the dream of a nearby sleeping creature, you can give the creature a horrific nightmare. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion and loses the benefit of a full rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> If you spend 4 hours focusing upon or within the dream of a nearby sleeping creature, you can weave their dream into a compelling world from which the dreamer doesn’t wish to awaken. The subject must make a Charisma saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature enters a deep slumber from which it doesn’t awaken. This slumber lasts for ten days. While in a deep slumber, the creature is unaffected by physical needs, such as hunger or thirst, and doesn’t age.</p>
            <p class="indent">Only Psychic Chirurgery, dispel evil and good, or wish can end the slumber early.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to last longer by spending additional power points. By spending 2 additional power points (13) the slumber will last one year plus an additional year for each extra power point you spend. If you spend at least 6 power points (17) this way, the slumber lasts until removed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>15.</i></b> You gain the ability to enter the Dreamscape when focusing on a sleeping creature. You project your consciousness into a dream, becoming a dream architect able to navigate the Dreamscape. You can travel between the dreams of other creatures. When traveling to a plane other than the Dreamscape, your body is transported, along with all belongings carried on your person.</p>
            <p class="indent">While in the Dreamscape, you can also manifest clairsentient and telepathic powers against a creature’s real body when you are within its dream. Only another creature operating within the Dreamscape can attack you. A dreamer is completely unaware of your presence so long as you choose, but if you attack its dream self, it becomes aware of you and can act according to dream logic.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you remain in the Dreamscape when this power ends, or if your dream self is slain, you return to your body with no ill effects.</p>

It can move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. It can move, lift, or carry objects, including basic tasks such as pouring a bottle or sweeping a floor.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture, Visual (overt)</p>
            <p>You create ectoplasm in a 10-foot square space within range. The ectoplasm has a gooey consistency that makes the surface difficult terrain.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature must make a Constitution saving throw against this power, it makes only one roll and applies the result to each effect of this power that requires a saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level, you can create an additional 10-foot square (2 squares). At 11th level you can create another 10-foot square (3 squares), and again at 17th level (4 squares). Additional squares must be contiguous.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Your ectoplasm is especially sticky. Each creature who enters or reenters the area or who starts its turn within the area must make a Strength saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature must spend 3 feet of movement for every foot moved until the end of its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can take a bonus action to cause your ectoplasm to lash out with grasping tendrils against a creature within 15 feet of it so long as this power remains in effect. You make a melee power attack to hit the creature. A creature hit by the tendril is grappled. At the end of each of your turns, a grappled creature is pulled 5 feet closer to your creation. It can use its action to make a Strength check against your power save DC to break free of the tendril. A creature can only be pulled into the first 5-foot space of your creation it enters, after which time it is freed of the tendril.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation. For every additional 2 power points spent to do so, your creation pulls the target an additional 5 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augmentation to increase the reach of your tendril by 15 feet (total 30 feet) by spending an additional 4 power points (7).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> Replace your squares with 10-foot cubes. Each cube must be contiguous and rest on a surface. Saving throws made against your ectoplasm are made with disadvantage when manifested as cubes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Your ectoplasm is disturbing to creatures which come into contact with it. Each creature within the ectoplasm when this power is manifested, who enters or reenters the area, or who end its turn in the area, must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature is unsettled so long as it remains in contact with your ectoplasm and for one minute after leaving the area.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 6 power points (11). A creature unsettled by your ectoplasm is also poisoned by it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> Your ectoplasm takes on an acidic quality. Each creature who enters or reenters the acid or who starts its turn in the acid must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature takes 2d8 acid damage and an additional 1d8 acid damage per 5 feet traveled through the area. If the save is successful, the creature takes half damage and doesn’t take any additional acid damage after exiting the acid.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature failing its save will also suffer an additional 1d8 acid damage after leaving the pool at the start of each of its turns so long as it remains in range and the power is in effect. At the end of each of its turns, the creature makes a new save, success ending the acid damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (13). Whenever a creature moves within 5 feet of your creation, you can use your reaction to cause your creation to burst in a 5-foot radius centered on the creature that triggered your reaction. Each creature within the radius is treated as if it had entered your creation. Additionally, the creature targeted by your reaction takes an additional 4d8 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful save.</p>

            <p>You telepathically whip a creature’s mind, crushing its confidence and infusing it with doubt. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the save is failed it is affected by this power so long as it remains in effect and until the end of its next turn after the power ends. The creature makes a new saving throw at the end of each or its turns to overcome the effect. If the save is successful, the power ends immediately for the creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature subtracts 1d4 from its attack rolls and ability checks when it fails its saving throw. Whenever the creature takes damage from a reaction, it can’t move until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Your target can’t make reactions or the Ready action while this power remains in effect.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Your target is frightened while this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> The creature is crippled with anguish and can only take the Dash action during its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>17.</i></b> You crush the creature’s ego, entrapping it in utter despair. It crumples to the ground and is incapacitated. The creature won’t attempt to defend itself. Each time it takes damage, it can make a new saving throw. If the save is successful, the power expires at the end of its next turn.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Visual (overt)</p>
            <p>Your body is able to stretch and bend in ways not normally possible. You can stretch your arms and legs (or other limbs) out an additional 10 feet. Doing so, you increase your movement and climb speeds by 5 feet while this power remains in effect. You can also use your action to move yourself to the extreme of your reach. This has no effect on your melee reach. You also can’t perform intricate tasks that require a skill check when stretched out.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can revert to your normal shape at will without taking an action, including any shape changes from augmentations of this power.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this power is in effect, you can substitute your melee power attack bonus in place of your melee weapon attack bonus. Also, your bones can’t be broken.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Increase the length you can stretch your limbs by 5 feet. You can take this augmentation multiple times. Each additional 10 feet of stretching increases your movement and climb speed an additional 5 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> When you stretch your arms, you can perform intricate tasks remotely, but do so with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (6) to not suffer disadvantage on ability checks because of this power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> Increase your melee reach by 5 feet while this power remains in effect. You can bend your attacks to reach around corners and cover. Your reach can’t be increased by more than you can stretch.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 5 additional power points you spend to do so, increase your melee reach another 5 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can flatten yourself, increasing your buoyancy and allowing you to float on air currents or with gusts of wind. Flattening yourself takes a bonus action, unless you are falling or in danger of being crushed, in which case you may do so using your reaction. Once flattened, you remain flat so long as this power is effect or you chose to resume your normal shape.</p>
            <p class="indent">You fall as if under the effect of feather fall. You can also float on water or other liquids, but this doesn’t grant you any protection from hazardous substances such as lava. You can also sail on the wind like a kite, moving at a rate equal to the wind, but you have no control of which direction you move. While flattened, you can’t be crushed or damaged by cave-ins and debris and can move through debris using your climb speed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> When you first manifest this power, or by using your action while it remains in effect, you can expand your body into a sphere with a radius of half your maximum stretch reach. As a sphere you have advantage on rolls to resist grapple and can’t be forced into a space smaller than your expanded size could fit within. Additionally, you can’t be knocked prone. You don’t gain any mass, and can still be pushed normally.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can roll to move, and double your normal movement speed when rolling downhill.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You gain the Amorphous trait, but treat movement through small spaces as difficult terrain.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to treat small spaces as standard terrain by spending an additional 4 power points (9).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You can rapidly bend and twist your body. This allows you to reduce all piercing and bludgeoning damage dealt to you by 1d10. When you grapple a creature, you may wrap the creature in your body, and gain advantage on your grapple check. You may use your manifesting ability score in place of your Strength when you grapple, and you are treated as one size category larger during the grapple.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you augment the length you can stretch by at least 6 power points, you can increase your size category for the purpose of grappling by an additional step.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 2 additional power points spent, increase the piercing and bludgeoning damage reduction by an additional 1d10.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You can expand your arms and fists into boulder-sized proportions. You can use your action to make a special attack against one creature and one additional creature, provided that creature is within 5 feet of the target. Each creature must make a Strength saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature takes 4d6 + your manifesting ability modifier bludgeoning damage and is knocked back 5 feet, or 10 feet if it is smaller than you. If a creature can’t be knocked back because of obstruction, that creature is knocked prone. A creature that is larger than you or one that succeeds its saving throw isn’t knocked back or prone.</p>

            <p>When this power is first manifested, and by using your action on subsequent turns while it remains in effect, you can transfer injury from a target you touch to yourself. You transfer 1d6 points of damage from a target to yourself. Damage you take as a result of this transference can’t be reduced or prevented, but also doesn’t require you to make a concentration save. You can’t transfer damage that would reduce you to less than 1 hit point.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level, increase the amount of damage transferred by 1d6 (2d6). At 11th level you transfer an additional 1d6 damage (3d6), and again at 17th level (4d6).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You can transfer injuries from yourself to another creature. You must succeed a melee power attack roll. If you succeed, you deal up to 1d6 necrotic damage to your target, and you regain an equal amount of hit points. You can transfer no more damage to the target than you have suffered. For example, if you have only suffered 2 points of damage, you can only deal 2 points of necrotic damage to your target regardless if your damage roll is 3 or higher. You can use your action on subsequent turns to transfer additional damage while this power remains in effect. This power gains no benefit from a critical hit.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your target is grappled, your melee power attack automatically hits. If a creature is willing, you also automatically hit.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> A hostile creature hit by your power must make an opposed grapple check against you. You may use your manifesting ability score in place of your Strength. If you win the grapple, your target is grappled.</p>

Transferred effects end when this power is no longer in effect or the spell or power expires on its own.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You can transfer blindness or deafness when you take or deal damage, even if 0 hit points are transferred.

If the creature is immune to the transferred effect, the effect ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You create an affinity link with a creature you hit with this power. So long as this power remains in effect, at your choice, each time your or the affected creature takes damage or regains hit points, the other receives the same damage or healing. An unwilling creature must make a Constitution saving throw when first hit. If the save fails, the creature remains in the affinity link so long as this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can transfer damage or an effect (if augmented that way) from one creature to another creature in your link without needing to make an attack roll, provided it is within 60 feet of you.</p>

            <p>Telekinetic force surrounds you. This force can protect you or imbue your attacks with telekinetic force. You take no damage or ill effect from your own manifestation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Ranged weapon attacks made against you are made with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">This is an energy power; you can substitute your energy specialization’s damage type in place of bludgeoning damage if you possess a class feature that permits this.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level you can maintain this power up to 5 minutes. At 11th level you can maintain this power up to 10 minutes. At 17th level, you can maintain this power up to 1 hour.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Once per round, you can cause one melee attack roll made against you to be made with disadvantage. You must declare using this feature before the attack roll result is known.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, your shroud makes it hard to move you. You have advantage on your rolls to resiting being pushed or grappled and on your checks to escape a grapple.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You enshroud your melee weapon attacks with telekinetic force. In addition to your normal damage, you deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 4 additional power points you spend, increase damage by 1d8 up to 8 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You can lash out with your shroud. Whenever a ranged or melee weapon attack is made within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack. Alternately, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that save or grant advantage to it (your choice).</p>
            <p class="indent">If you choose, you deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage to a creature whose melee weapon attack or Dexterity saving throw you impede this way.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Visual (overt)</p>
            <p>You summon unrestrained energy around you. It picks up loose objects within 5 feet of you and whirls them around like a tornado in a 5-foot radius cylinder with a height of 10 feet. You and objects on your person are immune to its effects. Your space becomes lightly obscured to creatures other than you while this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">This is an energy power; you can substitute your energy specialization’s damage type in place of the bludgeoning damage if you possess a class feature that permits this.</p>
            <p class="indent">This power has no effect if there are no loose objects or debris available in the area of effect unless the manifester has access to an energy specialization, in which case they can manifest the storm with that energy type.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Your storm becomes dangerous. Each creature that enters or reenters the area or starts its turn within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is failed, it takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage. If a creature triggers an opportunity attack from you, you can opt to use the storm to strike the target dealing 1d8 + your manifesting ability modifier bludgeoning damage on a successful hit using a melee power attack.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 4 power points you spend, you can increase the damage by 1d8.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> When a ranged weapon attack or projectile is aimed at you or a target within your storm, originates from within your storm, or passes through your storm, you may use your reaction to attempt to add it to your storm. Make a ranged power attack against an AC equal to the attack roll of the projectile. If the projectile has no attack roll, use the save DC instead. The object can be no larger than Tiny size. If you succeed, the attack has no effect and the object becomes part of your storm.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a stationary object is within your storm, you can take a bonus action to add it to your storm.</p>
            <p class="indent">Objects in your storm can be retrieved by a creature. It must make a Strength check against your power save DC. If successful, the object is removed from your storm and is held by the creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you manifest your storm with a radius greater than 5 feet, you can decide how far from you each creature or object controlled by your storm is.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 4 additional power points (7) to grab a Small or Medium sized object. Small and Medium sized objects in your storm can grant cover to you. At the start of each of your turns roll 1d6. If the result of the die is equal to or less than the number of Small and Medium sized objects within your storm, you are treated as having full cover until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation further to add creatures to your storm by spending an additional 4 power points (11). Whenever a Tiny or Small creature enters or reenters your storm or begins its turn within your storm, you can use your reaction to force it to make a Strength saving throw. If failed, the creature is restrained and added to your storm. It counts as an object for the purpose of granting you cover if it is Small sized. Additionally, you can use your reaction whenever you are attacked to have a creature in your storm struck instead. The attack must target only you and require an attack roll. Roll 1d6, on a roll of 1 or 2 the attack targets a creature within your storm of your choice, using its AC.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each restrained creature makes a new Strength saving throw at the start of each of its turns to escape the storm. If successful, the creature can act normally, but its movement speed is reduced by half until the end of its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augment to also affect creatures of Medium size or smaller by spending an additional 8 power points instead (15). This is otherwise identical to the earlier empowerment.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> Increase the radius of the storm by 5 feet. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>6.</i></b> You change the range of this power to 60 feet. During each of your turns you can use your action to move the storm up to 30 feet, provided it remains within range. The storm affects each target within its path.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to increase its range by 10 feet per additional power point spent.</p>

            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to gain further detail from a creature’s aura. For an additional 4 power points (5) you can see the creature’s emotional state. For an additional 8 power points (9) you can see a creature’s type and alignment. A creature must make a Charisma saving throw, which if successful causes this power to fail to reveal its type or alignment to you. You can’t attempt to see a creature’s aura again for 24 hours after it has succeeded this save.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Your perception is enhanced, granting you darkvision out to 60 feet or increasing existing darkvision you have by 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to allow you to see into nonmagical darkness as if it were bright light by spending an additional 4 power points (5). By further spending 2 more power points (7), this empowered vision will penetrate magical darkness.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You can see active enchantments and telepathic effects. You know if a creature, object, or structure is under the effect of a spell, power, or feature and what kind of effect it is, such as charm or a curse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You gain aurasight and can perceive a spiritfont, knowing what type it is and what emotion, if any, it bears as well as the historical context that created it (such as from a battle or a marriage). The stronger the emotion, the clearer the picture of historic events you perceive.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature controls a spiritfont it is allowed a Charisma saving throw to avoid detection from your perception. If the save is failed, you become aware of the presence and nature of the controlling creature as well as how long it has been present.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You see things as they really are. You automatically detect secret doors hidden by magic. You can perceive illusions for what they really are and automatically succeed any saving throw against illusions be they from spells, powers, or other effects. You are also aware if a location, object, or creature is possessed. A possessing creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the save succeeds, you aren’t made aware of its presence.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (13). While this power is in effect, you can use your action to target an illusion and make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 15. If the save succeeds, the illusion is suppressed so long as this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">Alternately, you can empower this augmentation to allow you to force a shapechanger to assume its normal form by spending 6 power points (15). You must use your action and the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If it fails this save, it is forced into its natural form and can’t change its shape for 1 minute.</p>

            <p>You can manipulate of one source of fire. While this power is in effect, you can switch control to another source of fire in range by taking a bonus action. You can only manipulate one fire source per round unless an augmentation specifically allows you to control more than one source.</p>
            <p class="indent">Fire you control with this power burns targets within it. Each creature that enters or reenters the area of the fire or that begins its turn within the fire must make a Dexterity saving throw. If this save is failed, the creature takes 1d8 fire damage. If successful, the creature takes half damage. Each unattended object caught in the fire takes 1d8 damage at the end of each of your turns.</p>
            <p class="indent">When this power ends, any fire without a source will be extinguished. Otherwise, the fire will burn normally.</p>
            <p class="indent">When first manifesting this power or by using your action on subsequent turns, you can douse a 5-foot square patch of flames or expand an existing flame to an adjacent 5-foot square.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level you can manipulate fire in a 10-foot square patch. At 11th level this increases to a 15-foot square patch of fire. At 17th level you can manipulate a 20-foot square patch or fire.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You increase the intensity of a nonmagical fire, which deals an additional 1d8 fire damage to each target within the same space (2d8 fire damage unless the source flame does greater than 1d8 damage normally). If the fire normally allows a saving throw, the additional fire damage is affected by the result of that save.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to affect psychic or magical flames, including those on weapons by spending an additional 2 power points (3). By further spending 4 more power points (7), you can intensify a creature composed of fire, such as a fire elemental, increasing the damage of each of its attacks and contact damage with it, if it possesses such a trait.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Decrease the intensity of a patch of nonmagical fire, which can be an object such as the flame of a torch. It deals one die less of fire damage. If this would reduce the damage to 0 dice, the fire becomes harmless.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to affect psychic or magical flames, including those on weapons by spending an additional 2 power points (3). By further spending 4 more power points (7), you can diminish a creature composed of fire, such as a fire elemental. At the start of its turn it must make a Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 force damage. You can spend additional power points when diminishing a fire creature, increasing the damage by 1d8 per 2 power points spent to do so up to 10 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> Affect an additional patch of fire. This patch must be contiguous with existing manipulated flame. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can shape nonmagical fire into new dimensions or into the shape of a simple, crude object, such as a pillar or dome. You can reshape fire onto a surface occupied by a creature, subjecting it to damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Using your action, you can move fire up to 20 feet. A fire that moves away from its source continues to burn do long as this power remains in effect. Each target caught in the path of the fire as it moves is subject to damage as if it entered the flame. A target can only be damaged by a moving fire once during your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this power remains in effect, you can use your action to change the shape of controlled flame.</p>

The golem is under your control, and you can direct it using a bonus action. Until otherwise ordered, the golem will repeat your last direction if able. If you don’t direct the golem, it will stand still and take no action, but will defend itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to create a second golem from a separate 5-foot patch of fire by spending 6 additional power points (17). You can issue the same command to each golem using the same bonus action.</p>

Once within that 8-hour period or until you take a short rest, you can use your reaction to get a sense of déjà vu and trigger this power’s effect. Once you’ve triggered it, this power ends. You can’t benefit from foresight again until completing a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a particular common object or item you could reasonably have obtained between manifesting this power and triggering it is desired, you can produce that item as if you had it in your possession the entire time.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture</p>
            <p>You can shape and alter sound within a 20-foot radius sphere. Unless indicated in the description of an augmentation, this doesn’t impact spellcasting.</p>
            <p class="indent">You transform sounds into other sounds you have heard, changing speech into garbled words, making a babbling brook sound like church bells, etc. You can even duplicate a speaker’s voice by making an Intelligence (Deception) check, but a speaker most likely will stop speaking once it realizes the words coming from its mouth aren’t its own.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You change the volume of any number of sounds in the area of effect. You can turn a whisper into a shout or make the rain sound like a mounted cavalry charge, or you could turn a clap of thunder into a gentle sigh or make the words from another’s mouth come out inaudible. You don’t prevent the verbal component of a spell being cast.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> Increase the radius by 5 feet. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You dampen sounds granting each creature within the sphere advantage to hide checks to remain silent and damage resistance to thunder.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to suppress all sounds within the sphere by spending an additional 4 power points (7). Spells requiring a verbal component can’t be cast within the sphere. Each creature within the area of effect gains immunity to thunder damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Alternately, you can empower this augmentation to suppress each sound you choose by spending an additional 10 power points (13). Each creature you choose gains immunity to thunder damage while it remains within the sphere. You can use your reaction to cancel a spell requiring a verbal component.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You amplify sounds causing each creature within the sphere to have disadvantage on hide checks and saving throws against thunder damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> Using a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, provided it remains within range.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You condense and amplify any sound into a destructive pitch within the sphere as an instantaneous effect when you first manifest this power. You can repeat this function by using your action on subsequent turns so long as this power remains in effect. Each target in the area takes 2d8 thunder damage. Each creature affected must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to increase the damage by 1d8 per 4 additional power points you spend.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Each creature within the sphere you choose must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature is deafened so long as it’s within the area of effect and for one minute after leaving it. If a deafened creature reenters the sphere, it is deafened again and will be deafened for one minute after leaving the sphere again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You can manifest a second sphere equal in size to the first sphere. You can freely transfer sounds from one sphere to the other at any volume you choose. If a thunder damage effect strikes one sphere, you can use your reaction to transfer or copy that effect to the other.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> You can reshape sounds within the effect area. When this power is first manifest, or when you use your action while this power is in effect, you can form sounds into sonic walls. These walls are dome shaped and must be centered at the point of origin of your spheres. The domes surround your sphere. One side of the wall, selected by you, deals 2d8 thunder damage to any creature or object within 5 feet of that side when you manifest this power and again at the start of each of your turns so long as this power remains in effect. Each creature attempting to pass through the sonic wall on this side must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature takes 5d8 thunder damage and can’t move until the start of its next turn short of teleportation and similar effects. If successful, the creature suffers half damage and can move freely through the wall. Any creature can freely pass through the wall from the side that doesn’t deal damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> You create a sonic elemental golem under your control. You can use a bonus action to direct the golem. Until otherwise ordered, the golem will repeat your last direction if able. If the golem has no directions, it will stand still and take no action, but will defend itself if attacked.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture</p>
            <p>You can move, shape, and alter the state of water. When you first manifest this power or by using your action during subsequent turns while this power remains in effect, you may reshape the water, move the water, or change the consistency of the water. When this power is no longer in effect, the water will follow the course of nature (ice may melt, fog will disperse or re-condense, water will flow downhill, etc).</p>
            <p class="indent">You can control one 5-foot cube of water. You can shape it into simple shapes, move it up to 30 feet in any direction, or change its state (water to snow or ice and vise versa). You can transform lightly obscured fog into heavily obscured fog or vice versa or disperse or create lightly obscured fog.</p>
            <p class="indent">Ice covering a surface is difficult terrain. Each creature attempting to move over this ice must make a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">Snow surfaces can be walked on by Medium sized and smaller creatures (larger creatures will fall through the snow). Snow surfaces that are moved also move each creature on it. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is successful the creature isn’t moved from its space.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Control an additional 5-foot cube of water. The water must be in range. Contiguous cubes can be controlled as one mass. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Increase the maintenance time by 1 minute. You can take this augmentation multiple times up to 9 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can shape contiguous water into a wall. You can also transform contiguous 5-foot cubes into a hemispherical dome with a diameter equal to the number of cubes you form into the dome.</p>
            <p class="indent">A wall of water causes each ranged attack passing through the wall to be made with disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Effects that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid, transforming that section of the wall into a wall of ice.</p>
            <p class="indent">A wall of ice is 1-foot thick in a given 5-foot section. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it forms, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 2d6 cold damage per 2 power points spent on this power, or half as much on a successful save. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12, 15 hit points per 5-foot section, and is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a section to 0 hit points destroys it, transforming it into a wall of water. You can redistribute the hit points of your wall sections by using a bonus action so long as the panels are contiguous.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You can make an attack with one cube of your water when you manifest this power or by taking an action on your turn while this power remains in effect. The target must be within 30 feet of your water cube, and you must make a ranged power attack. If you hit, you deal 4d6 damage that can be bludgeoning, cold, piercing, or slashing (your choice when you make the attack).</p>
            <p class="indent">At your option, a water elemental or other creature with the Freeze trait struck with this attack must make a Constitution saving throw. If failed, the creature is affected as described by the trait so long as this power remains in effect. At the end of each of its turns it makes a new saving throw. If this save is successful, the creature is no longer impaired and you must use your action to refreeze it.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. Increase the direct damage from attacks made by this power by 1d6 per 3 additional power points spent.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You shape a 5-foot cube of water or ice into an elemental golem of the same type. This golem is under your control and you can direct it with a bonus action. Until otherwise ordered, the golem will repeat your last direction if able. If given no direction, the golem will stay in place taking no action, but will defend itself if attacked.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to create a second golem by spending an additional 6 power points (15). You can issue the same command to each golem using the same bonus action.</p>

            <p>Entering into a deep meditative state, you can focus your mind on recalling memories deep within you, or you can tap into the shared Collective Conscious of the multiverse to gain knowledge you don’t normally possess.</p>
            <p class="indent">In recalling a memory, you can remember any moment you experienced with vivid detail and perfect accuracy, recalling names spoken, faces seen, and so on. You can recall events lost from amnesia without requiring a saving throw or ability check, including those caused by powers and spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you tap the Collective Conscious, you are able to apply your proficiency bonus to the next Intelligence skill or tool check made within 1 hour of using this power, but may only do so once per rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You sense the presence of magic and psychic energy within 30 feet of you, provided you have line of sight. You get a basic understanding of the power of the magic or psychic effect, as well as what school or discipline it is.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You discover if any magical or psionic effects are active upon one creature within 30 feet of you, and which spells and powers those are.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 4 power points spent in this way, you can detect effects on an additional creature within 30 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> One magical or psionic item you hold has its properties revealed to you. You learn how to use the item, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells or powers are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you are made aware of the fact, but not which spell made it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You tap the Collective Conscious to ponder a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days, or one that occurred in the last 7 years. The DM will give you an honest answer which might be a short vision, a cryptic passage, or an omen.</p>
            <p class="indent">This revelation does not take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome. If you attempt to use this power to address the same goal, event, or activity, the power will fail.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> Delving deep into the Collective Conscious, you glean knowledge about a person, place, or object without any prior knowledge required. You can make an Intelligence check with your proficiency bonus to uncover facts about your topic subject to the discretion of the DM.</p>
            <p class="indent">For knowledge skills you possess regarding subjects you could know, you may use this power to gain expertise with your skill, doubling your proficiency bonus with the option to reroll a failed roll for 1 hour after manifesting this power. If you do reroll, you must accept the result of the new roll.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> Tapping the shared knowledge of the multiverse, you discover facts about a creature you know. This creature can be one you’ve met or seen remotely through psychic power or magic. You gain the following information about the creature: name (including aliases, but not the true names of fiends and celestials), race, alignment, hit dice, class levels possessed, its current location, significant items in its possession, and any significant activity or actions it has taken within the past 8 hours. Additionally, you get a mental picture of the creature which you can maintain concentration upon for ten minutes without suffering psychic strain.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to overcome effects like mind blank, intellect fortress, and similar abilities from other sources by spending an additional 4 power points (17). You must make a Wisdom check against the caster’s spell or manifester’s power save DC to do so.</p>

The creature can’t be a construct, ooze, plant, or undead. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature suffers the effect of this power so long as it remains in effect or until the power is ended through other means. If successful, the creature is not affected by this power and the power ends on it.</p>
            <p class="indent">One creature in range can’t take the Dash action.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> One additional target in range is affected. You can take this augment multiple times up to 10 power points. You can’t take this augmentation if you create a dome or wall.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You create a barrier around a willing creature which can be you, that slows projectiles and movement within its space. All missile attacks made against and by the target are at disadvantage. The creature may use a reaction to grab missiles from ranged weapon attacks. Up to one missile per Dexterity bonus (minimum of 1) can be grabbed this way until the start of the creature’s next turn. Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from melee weapon attacks made by and against the target are halved. The target only takes half damage from falling, including being thrown against walls, and isn’t knocked prone from such events.</p>
            <p class="indent">This augmentation can be empowered by spending an additional 2 power points (5) to make the target unaffected by the negative aspects of this power. Additionally, when the target is attacked by a melee attack, it can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against its attacker. This reaction is resolved before the attack that triggered it.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can spend 4 additional power points (9) to further empower this augmentation to also reduce bludgeoning damage from telekinetic attacks by half on the target. Telekinetic attacks made by the target are unaffected.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You create an invisible field of force that dampens inertia. You can target a point in space within range and create a barrier in a 10-foot radius hemispherical dome. Each creatures within, or entering the area of effect, is immediately subject to the effects of this power. Additionally, missile attacks that require a ranged attack roll into or out of the field automatically miss, provided they are a solid mass such as an arrow, rock, or globule of acid.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a target leaves the dome, it remains affected by this power until the end of its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 3 power points spent, increase the radius of the dome by 5 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You create a wall comprised of a 10-foot square panel that stops all movement through it. Physical attacks, such as those made with weapons, can’t be made through the wall. Ranged projectile attacks freeze is midair so long as the power remains in effect, while melee weapons simply cease movement on contact with the barrier. It is impossible to move through the wall, and each creature attempting to do so must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature can’t move until the start of its next turn. Nonphysical attacks, such a telepathic attacks or magical energy can pass through the wall without incident.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 2 power points spent, you create an additional 10-foot square panel. Additional panels must connect with another panel, but don’t have to be in a straight line.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> Your inertial barrier becomes a stasis barrier. Each target it affects is frozen in time so long as the power remains in effect. Each creature affected must make a Dexterity saving throw. If successful the creature escapes the stasis field. In the case of a dome, the creature moves to the nearest unoccupied space outside the dome. If the save fails, the creature gains the stasis condition.</p>

You are proficient with these weapons, and you can use your manifesting ability modifier in place of Strength on attack and damage rolls. A living weapon can’t be disarmed. When you manifest this power, you choose whether your living weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, and if you manifest two weapons at once, they don’t have to be the same damage type.</p>

At the end of each of its turns, the creature makes a new save, which, if successful, ends the blood loss. A creature can only suffer blood loss from your living weapons once per turn.

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic</p>
            <p>While this power is in effect, you are able to read the surface thoughts of one creature in range by taking a bonus action. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. If the save is failed you know what it is thinking, whether it is lying or telling the truth, or if it is concealing information. You may only discern one parcel of information during your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature is distracted and unaware of your attention, it makes the save with disadvantage. The target creature must think in a language you understand or express strong feelings such as rage or hunger. A creature trained to protect its thoughts from telepathic reading may have means to mislead or stymie your efforts at the discretion of the DM.</p>
            <p class="indent">While there are no direct benefits in combat, circumstance can provide tactical advantage. For instance, a creature may be thinking about luring the party into a trap, and reading its thoughts can make the manifester aware of this, allowing the manifester to alert the rest of the party or circumvent the creature’s plan another way.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> Starting at 11th level, when you attempt to read or probe the mind of an incapacitated creature, it automatically fails its Intelligence save.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> By taking a bonus action, you seek the answer to general knowledge questions, such as whether a specific person is at a certain location or if the creature is attempting to deceive you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> While reading thoughts, you attempt to make a subject think of a specific topic. You could learn when the watch shifts change at a warehouse, or you can cause the creature to think of the answer to the riddle it poses.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> After successfully reading a creature’s mind you are freely able to read its every thought until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> By taking a bonus action you probe the creature’s mind for information that you are aware exists. For example, if you know a creature knows the proper way to unlock a special locking mechanism, you can withdraw that procedure.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>8.</i></b> Whenever a creature resists your probe attempts (but not your mind reading attempts), you can use your reaction to mentally lash it. It must make another Intelligence saving throw. If the save is failed, it takes 4d6 psychic damage. If successful, the creature takes half the damage. On subsequent turns, the creature can voluntarily fail its save to resist your probe, avoiding the psychic damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending additional power points. For every 2 additional power point2 you spend, increase the psychic damage by 1d6 up to 8 power points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> By taking a bonus action you delve for any information the subject possesses, including information you are unaware the subject possesses. When you probe its mind, you gain additional information about the topic. Secrets, scandalous information, and peculiar knowledge are most likely to be learned, your DM will decide what additional kernels you glean. On later turns, you can probe for further information regarding topics you uncover. For instance, you could root in the subject’s mind to find information about its king and discover the king is an imposter, and on later turns find out who is involved with the conspiracy.</p>

            <p>You link minds with a willing creature within 30 feet of you. This link persists over any distance so long as you remain on the same plane of existence. Unwilling creatures can’t be linked.</p>
            <p class="indent">While linked, you and each linked creatures can send a telepathic message to each member of the link you choose by taking a bonus action. Members must share a common language to understand messages.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each linked creature also gains the Hive Mind trait. Hive Mind grants each member of the link a +1 bonus on its first attack roll against a target another member has damaged until the start of that member’s next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level you may add two additional creatures to the link (3 creatures). At 11th level you may add two more creatures (5 creatures), and two additional creatures again at 17th level (7 creatures).</p>

            <p class="indent">This augmentation can be empowered by spending 4 additional power points (5). Whenever one member of the link within 240 is not surprised by an encounter, no member of the link is surprised. Additionally, each member’s Passive Perception is increased to the highest member’s Passive Perception within 240 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> You enhance Hive Mind, granting a +1 bonus on damage rolls to members who benefit from the attack roll bonus of Hive Mind.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation. For every 4 additional power points you spend, increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augmentation by spending 8 power points (10). Whenever a member has an attack bonus from Hive Mind, it makes its attack roll with advantage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> Each linked creature can transmit rough concepts to beasts and other creatures with limited language capacity within the link. The creature must have an Intelligence of 4 or less. Beasts can transmit simple sentiments, such as “danger” or “distrust.” The beast may not necessarily take the action you want.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation. By spending an additional 6 power points (9) you can transmit thoughts to a creature without sharing a common language regardless of the creature’s intelligence.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> While this power is in effect, you can use your action to add an additional willing creature to the link or remove an existing member (other than you). You can only have a number of creatures equal to your level linked at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>6.</i></b> Transmitting thoughts no longer requires a bonus action and can be done at will during a linked creature’s turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You can share sensory data with members of the link. You can either transmit to each member of the link you choose or you can retrieve sensory data from one member of the group you choose. This allows you to see, hear, etc. as another member of the link senses or to share your sensations to each linked member you choose.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a member of the group possesses blindsight, darkvision, tremorsense or another sensory trait, each member of the link shares that trait so long as the member providing the trait isn’t incapacitated.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> Each beneficial telepathic power or mind-affecting spell, such as heroism or Bardic Inspiration, that targets a linked member targets all members of the link.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 4 additional power points (17). Each member of the link can use the Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw of the member with the highest value. Whenever a member of the link would lose concentration on a spell or power, another member can use its reaction to assume concentration to persist the effect. At the end of the next linked creature’s turn the caster or manifester must resume concentration or the effect ends. This power is a valid target for this feature. If the member is a spell caster of the same class as an assumed spell’s concentration or a manifester of a class in which the power is on its list of potential power, the creature can fully assume concentration on that spell or power. The spell or power remains at its original casting or manifesting strength. A spell will end when its duration runs out. A power will cause psychic strain when its maintenance time is exceeded.</p>

The creature may use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes and the power ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">Since the target creature is still exactly where it started, it can be acted upon while it is in this state. Functionally, the creature is paralyzed. If the creature receives damage, this power immediately ends.</p>

A creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.</p>

A Large or larger object has an additional 5-foot cube portion rendered to dust. A creature takes 3d8 + 9 force damage on subsequent turns when you use your action. If you don’t use your action to continue disintegrating your target, this power ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you augment this power to target multiple objects, you can target additional creatures instead. Each creature or object must be within 5 feet of another creature or object affected by this power.

            <p>You use shaped telekinetic forces to manipulate objects. When you first manifest this power and by taking a bonus action on your subsequent turns while this power is in effect, you can direct your puppet, and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction. An object moved in this manner inflicts no damage on collision.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can move up to two small, unattended objects, weighing a total 25 pounds or less which are within 5 feet of each other. When you move, you can automatically move your puppet with you in the same way without taking a bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level you can move up to three objects totaling no more than 50 pounds. At 11th level you can move up to four objects with a total weight of 75 pounds or less and items can be moved independently using the same bonus action. At 17th level you can move up to five items weighing a total of not more than 100 pounds.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You can use an object you control to strike a target within 5 feet of it by making a melee power attack roll. If the object is a weapon you deal its weapon damage including any bonuses from magic enchantments or psionic enhancements that don’t require attunement (unless it is a weapon with which you are already attuned). If it’s a nonweapon object, consult the Puppet Object Statistic Table to determine its damage. A makeshift weapon will deal damage appropriate to the object. You add your manifesting ability bonus to damage rolls with an object you control. Only one object can attack when you use your bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent">A manipulated object can be attacked. Consult the Puppet Objects Statistics Table for hit points and AC of controlled object. When an object’s hit points are reduced to 0, the telekinetic force manipulating it dissipates and it falls to ground.</p>
            <p class="indent">Puppet Object Statistics Table</p>

            <p class="indent">Huge	80	10	2d12</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to allow you to manipulate larger objects. Increase the maximum weight you can manipulate by 25 pounds for every additional power point you spend.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augmentation by spending an additional 6 power points (7) allowing you to strike with multiple objects at once provided each controlled object attacks the same target</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You can move the manipulated target 10 additional feet. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> You can target one attended object held by a creature, but not worn. The creature holding the object must make a Strength saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature retains control of the object, but during each of your turns while this power remains in effect you can use your action to attempt to seize the object again. If the save is failed, the creature loses hold of the object and you gain control.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can manipulate objects with greater deftness allowing your telekinesis to use Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) and Dexterity (Performance) skills and tool proficiencies using half your proficiency bonus but without adding your ability bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (7) to manipulate objects with precision, using your full proficiency bonus and either your Dexterity or manifesting ability bonus (whichever is higher) on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) and Dexterity (Performance) skills and tool proficiency rolls.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You can target a Medium sized creature instead of objects. It must make a Strength saving throw. If it succeeds it is unaffected this round, but must make a new saving throw whenever you attempt to manipulate it by using your bonus action while this power remains in effect. If the save is failed, you manipulate the creature and it is restrained and its movements is under your control until the start of your next turn. While controlling a creature you can use your action to make weapon attacks and take other physical actions. You use your proficiency bonus and manifester’s ability when you do so, but have access to any item the creature has. You can also use other puppetry power functions you manifested using the controlled creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to manipulate one additional creature for every 5 additional power points you spend.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also spend an additional 6 power points (11) to empower this augmentation to affect a Large creature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You can rapidly move targets you manipulate with force. You can use your puppet to attack a target. When you do so, make a ranged power attack. You deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet the puppet is moved. The puppet takes half the damage dealt.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also choose to slam your target against a surface or large object (such as a pillar). In this case, your target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet moved. An object hit in this fashion takes half the damage the puppet takes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> Instead of moving your target, you can crush it, dealing 6d6 bludgeoning damage to it. A creature must make a Strength saving, which if successful results in half damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, increasing the damage dealt by 2d6 per 3 additional power points spent.</p>

            <p>You gain the ability to view remotely, outside your normal sense of sight. Any enhanced visual detection you possess also applies to your remote sight. With the exception of blindsight, only one remote sight feature can be active when you manifest this power regardless of augmentations.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can see all around you. You can no longer be flanked and features that are enabled for foes by having an ally within 5 feet of you don’t function against you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You can maintain this power for 1 additional minute. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You gain blindsight out to 60 feet or your sensor has blindsight up to 60 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You create a remote sensor at a location up to one mile from you that is familiar to you or an obvious location unfamiliar to you. The sensor can’t be attacked or interacted with. You can use your action to move the censor up to 60 feet per round.</p>
            <p class="indent">If detected by means that can see invisible objects, the sensor appears as a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.</p>
            <p class="indent">This augmentation can be empowered to allow you to hear through your sensor by spending 2 additional power points.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augmentation to allow you to use your sensor as the point of origin for your psionic powers that don’t require an attack roll by spending an additional 6 power points. In order to maintain a power manifested through your sensor you must be within that power’s range or it fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can empower this augmentation to create an additional sensor by spending an additional 4 power points or two additional sensors by spending an additional 8 power points. Each sensor operates independently. When you use an action to move a sensor, you can choose to do so with any number of sensors you control. When you control more than one sensor, you can only perceive through one at a time, but can change which sensor you use at will once per round on your turn.</p>

            <p>You inflict atrophy and fatigue upon one creature. It must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature suffers 1d6 necrotic damage. At the end of each of its turns, it makes a new saving throw so long as this power remains in effect. If the save is failed, the creature takes 1 necrotic damage.

            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 8 additional power points (9). Each turn the creature suffers periodic damage from this power and takes an action, bonus action, or reaction, it suffers an additional level of exhaustion without limit.</p>

            <p>Ripping apart the fabric of the mind, you induce insanity to a foe. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. If this save succeeds, the power fails. This power has no effect against celestials, constructs, fiends, oozes, plants, or undead. When you augment this power with a different effect, that effect replaces the at-will effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">A calm emotions spell or telempathic projection power can suppress the effects of this power. Dispel evil and good will end it while it is being maintained.</p>
            <p class="indent">You induce paranoia in the target, causing it to become suspicious of everything and anyone. The creature will hear phantom sounds. The creature can’t be charmed, and any attempt to deceive or negotiate with it fails. The creature regards all friendly acquaintances as neutral, and all neutral parties as hostile. The creature is at disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma ability checks.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level you can maintain this power for an additional minute (2 minutes). At 11th level you can maintain it for another minute (3 minutes), and again at 17th level (4 minutes).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Your target suffers mad cackles and will laugh at completely inappropriate times. Any time it is under stress, such as in combat or attempting to use a tool, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If this save fails, the creature does nothing but stands still and laughs until the beginning of its next turn, becoming incapacitated.</p>
            <p class="indent">In other situations, roll a d10. If you roll 1-7, nothing happens, but on 8-10, the afflicted creature will laugh at length. Situations could be during a dramatic negotiation, a funeral, or even just silence.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> For every round you maintain this power on a creature the effects will linger for 1 minute.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the effects linger, the target is allowed a new Intelligence saving throw after the linger interval (1 minute, 10 minutes, or 1 hour). If the save succeeds, the creature suppresses the insanity until the same time passes. After succeeding three such saving throws, the power ends. If the creature is afflicted by the insanity for at least 2 hours without interruption, the insanity becomes permanent. Only greater restoration, wish, or Psychic Chirurgery can end a permanent insanity.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (6) to allow it to linger for 10 minutes per round you maintained it. By spending a further 4 power points (10), the effect will linger 1 hour per round you maintain this power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Induced with berserk rage, your target is violent toward everyone around it. At the start of each of its turn, if there is another creature in sight, the afflicted creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If this save is failed, the creature will immediately attack the nearest creature using its full combat ability with the intent to kill the other creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the afflicted creature reduces its target to 0 hit points, it will move on to the next closest target. If there are no other targets in sight, it will direct any attacks at the body of the last creature attacked, even if that creature is dead.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Overcome with indescribable terror, the target is afflicted with fear and hallucinations. Within every shadow is a fiend, behind every corner is a foe, and within every crack is some eldritch horror waiting for the right moment to strike. The creature will attempt to irrationally flee from any creature, often in the most direct path without any regard for its own safety, willing to run off a cliff or into a raging river. It makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to avoid causing itself harm, turning to avoid such hazards on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the creature is alone, it makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw when first affected by this power and every 10 minutes thereafter so long as this power remains in effect. If this check is failed, the creature perceives a hallucination of something hostile or even just the idea that something hostile is lurking nearby, and it will run away from it.</p>
            <p class="indent">While afflicted, the creature can only take the Dash action and will use its movement to move in a straight line away from the closest creature. If it runs into another creature or obstruction, it will turn in a different direction and continue to run in a straight path. If the creature is grappled or restrained, it will struggle to escape (in this case, it may use its action to escape if applicable), and if it can’t escape it takes 3d10 psychic damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies of fright.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You afflict your target with a long-term madness while this power remains in effect. You may choose from or roll randomly on the long-term madness table in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p>

            <p>You create a tear in space that pulls creatures and objects toward it. Once placed, you can’t move the singularity, but you can suppress each of its effects you choose at will during your turn until the beginning of your next turn. Each creature that begins its turn within the same space as the point of origin of the singularity must make a Constitution saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature takes 1d6 force damage and is unable to move until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level this power’s damage increases by 1d6 (2d6). At 11th level the damage increases by another 1d6 (3d6), and once again at 17th level (4d6).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> If you spend 1 or more power points to augment this power, you deal half damage to a target that succeeds its saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Your singularity pulls small missiles, such as arrows and bolts, as well as spells and powers that fire a missile of some form (magic missile, mind spike, etc.), which are sucked into the singularity if they cross within a 10-foot radius sphere from the origin point. Missiles at twice the radius of the sphere make attack rolls with disadvantage with a miss resulting in the missile being pulled toward the singularity, but not into it. Nonmagical object missiles and missiles from spells and powers are simply gone when they are pulled into the singularity.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 4 additional power points (5) to cause movement within a 10-foot radius of the point of origin to be treated as difficult terrain. Each creature that begins its turn within this area must make Strength saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature is unable to move until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> Increase the singularity’s damage by 1d6. Additionally, each target within the radius of your singularity, if augmented to have a radius effect, takes half the power’s damage at the start of each of its turns (or your turn in the case of an object).</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature must make a Constitution saving throw, which if successful negates this damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">This augmentation automatically empowers. For every 3 power points you spend on this power, the damage increases another 1d6 at no additional cost.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> Increase the radius your other augmentation effects by 10 feet. The point of origin for this power isn’t expanded. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You manifest a dimensional tether connecting either yourself or a creature to your singularity, provided it is no more than 30 feet from it. An unwilling creature must make a Strength saving throw, success resulting in the creature escaping the tether.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you manifest this power, you set the maximum tether distance, but it can’t be shorter than 30 feet or greater than 600 feet. Additionally, if you choose, the tethered creature must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot moved in any direction except toward the singularity.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature attempts to move beyond the tether’s maximum range, it must make a Strength saving throw. If the save fails, the creature is unable to move away from the tether until the start of its next turn. If the creature moves out of range of the tether, the link is broken and the creature is freed. If another creature attempts to move a tethered creature beyond the tether’s range, that creature must make a Strength check against your power save DC unless moving the creature through a spell or power, in which case it makes a spell or power attack roll against your power save DC.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature falls, the tether will catch it with no check required. If the creature is transported through extra dimensional means such as teleportation or moving to another plane of existence, the tether will automatically break.</p>
            <p class="indent">Using a bonus action, you can move the tethered creature up to 30 feet in the direction of the singularity.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to affect an additional creature for every 4 additional power points spent. You determine each tether’s property at the time of manifestation. When you use your bonus action, you move each tethered creature you choose.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augmentation to restrain each tethered creature you choose by spending 6 additional power points (11). At the start of each of its turns, it must make a Strength saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature is restrained until the start of its next turn. If the save succeeds, the creature can move, but must spend 3 feet of movement per 1 foot moved until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Each Medium sized or smaller creature or object that weighs no more than 200 pounds that is not latched to a surface is pulled toward your singularity. Each creature that begins its turn within a 10-feet radius of your singularity must make a Strength saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature is restrained until the end of its turn and is moved 5 feet closer to the singularity. Objects move at the end of each of your turns.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 6 power points (13) to affect Large creatures or objects that weigh no more than 800 pounds. By spending a further 4 power points (17), you can affect Huge creatures or objects weighing no more than 2 tons.</p>

            <p>You change your size. You shrink one size level smaller and gain advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. If you augment this power to grow, you don’t gain this benefit.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you are smaller, you are half your normal size and one-eighth your normal weight. You suffer no loss to Strength or damage dealt.</p>
            <p class="indent">This power will not stack with itself or with other means of changing size, such as enlarge/reduce. It can be used to cancel the effect of size alteration.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level you can maintain this power for an additional minute (2 minutes). At 11th level you can maintain it for another minute (3 minutes), and again at 17th level (4 minutes).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You grow one size level larger, gaining advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. If there isn’t enough space to hold the new size, you attain the maximum size possible.</p>
            <p class="indent">When larger you are twice your normal size and weigh eight times your normal weight. Your melee weapon attacks deal 1d6 extra damage of the same type.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to grow to four times your normal size and weight sixty-four times more than you normally weigh, increasing your size category by two sizes by spending an additional 12 power points (13). You gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and treat each roll for these under 12 as a 12. Your weapon attacks deal 2d6 extra damage of the same type.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are already Huge or Gargantuan, you become Gargantuan with a height of 40 feet, or 10 feet taller than you currently are, whichever is larger.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> The range changes to touch. An unwilling creature must make a Constitution saving throw, if failed, the creature’s size is changed.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to affect each creature you choose within a 10-foot cube by spending an additional 8 power points (10).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> A creature shrunk by your power doesn’t gain any benefit from it. Instead, it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. Any weapon the target holds or possesses becomes unwieldy, and it is at disadvantage on attack rolls with the weapon. Damage the creature deals from melee weapon attacks is reduced by 1d6 points, but will always do at least 1 point of damage. Additionally, the creature’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet if the creature can move).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>6.</i></b> You cause a creature you increase in size to bloat. It gains no benefit from the power. Instead it has disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Due to its sudden bulk, it has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls. Additionally, the creature’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet if the creature can move).</p>
            <p class="indent">If the creature’s size is larger than the space it is in, it must make a DC 15 Strength check. If the check is failed, the creature becomes restrained. If successful, the creature moves to the nearest space it can fit up to 10 feet away. If the space is still insufficient, the creature is restrained. On each of its turns it can use its action to attempt the Strength check again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You shrink to one-fourth your normal size and weigh only one-sixty-fourth your normal weight, reducing your size category by two sizes smaller. You gain advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws, and treat rolls for these under 12 as a 12. Melee and ranged attacks made against you are made with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are already Small or Tiny, you become Tiny with a height of only one foot unless you are normally smaller (in which case this power does nothing).</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to reduce your size to 1 inch tall by spending and additional 6 power points (15). This confers no other advantages.</p>

            <p>You move and react at extreme speed. You increase your movement speed by 10 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> For every 3 power points you spend to augment this power, increase your movement speed by an additional 10 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Through preternatural reflex, you gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws and can’t be given disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws. If you succeed a Dexterity saving throw that would normally result in reduced damage, you take none.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You are able to move across liquid surfaces – such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava – as if it were solid ground. You are still at risk of damage from hazardous surfaces, such as molten lava. If you are restrained or your movement halted, you will sink into the liquid.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to allow you move on air as if it were solid ground by spending an additional 8 power points (11). You can move through levitation effects and reverse gravity using your normal movement speed. If you are restrained or your movement halted, you will fall.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can run along walls. If you are restrained, or your movement otherwise halted while you are running along a wall, you will fall (unless the restraint would make that impossible).</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to allow you to run along ceilings by spending an additional 2 power points (5). If your movement is halted or restrained you will fall.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Every movement you make is like a blur. You gain a +2 to AC and a +2 on all melee attack rolls. When you take the Attack action, you may make an extra attack. This attack is in addition to any other extra attacks. If this extra attack misses, you can redirect it to attack another creature in range. In lieu of this extra attack, you can take the Dash action. This power doesn’t stack with haste and similar effects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Gaining remarkable reflexes and movement speed, you can use your reaction to use the Dash action when a foe or ally moves within 5 feet of you or takes an action within 5 feet of you. Once per round, when you take this Dash or make an opportunity attack, you don’t use your reaction.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (9) to allow you to strike a second creature within reach with a melee weapon when you make an opportunity attack using that weapon. By spending 2 more power points (11), you can direct that second attack against the same target.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You move almost like lightning, adding your proficiency bonus to your AC and Dexterity saving throws (if you already have proficiency with Dexterity saving throws, double your bonus).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You may take a bonus action to teleport up to 30 feet anywhere you can see.</p>

            <p>You place a psionic ward on a creature. This ward causes intense pain to a spirit if the creature comes into contact with the warded recipient (or attempts to cross the boundary of a warded space if this power is augmented to affect an area). Spirits include celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. You choose which creature types are affected at the time of manifestation.</p>
            <p class="indent">A warded creature has certain protections. Each creature of the warded type has disadvantage on attack rolls against a warded creature. The warded creatures also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Increase the maintenance to 10 minutes.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to increase the maintenance by 10 minutes for every additional 2 power points you spend.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> You affect one additional creature. You can take this augmentation multiple times. You can’t take this augmentation if you create a ward against a specific, unique creature or if you create a ward covering an area.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> Instead of a creature, you affect a 20-foot cube. Creatures of the type warded against can’t enter the area. Creatures within the warded area can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by creatures of the type affected. If a creature of the type warded against attempts to enter the warded area through magic or similar means, it fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 8 additional power points (15) to increase the area to a 1-mile radius cylinder that is 50 feet tall.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You place a ward around the warded creature type, trapping it within. The ward is equal to the space of the creature. When first manifested, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If this save succeeds, the creature will move to the nearest safe, unoccupied space outside the ward. If the save is failed, the creature is trapped. It can use its action to make a new Charisma saving throw. If this save is successful, the creature is able to move outside the warded area if its movement speed allows. A trapped creature suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, and creatures outside the warded area can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> You create a special ward against one particular, unique creature. This special ward contains the creature inside a cylindrical barrier that is large enough to cover the creature plus five feet to each side and above it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature must make a Charisma saving throw when the power is first manifested. The special ward will linger for 1 hour for every round you maintain this power. You can attempt to renew the ward by manifesting this power again, but the trapped creature is permitted a new saving throw in this case. The special ward can be cancelled by dispel evil and good, wish, or psychic static.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 4 additional power points (17). The creature makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p>

            <p>You create a telekinetic force that can lift one Medium sized or smaller creature or an object weighing no more than 100 pounds and suspend it in the air. When you manifest this power, the target is lifted up to 10 feet from a surface. A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. If this save is successful, the creature is unaffected by this power. If a flying creature is affected, it loses half of its flying speed and can’t fly down.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the power ends, the target falls and is subject to falling damage (1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen) and if it is a creature, it is knocked prone.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>0.</i></b> At 5th level you can lift an object that weighs no more than 250 pounds. At 11th level this limit increase to 500 pounds. At 17th level you can lift an object up to 1,000 pounds.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You can use your action to move a lifted creature or object up to 20 feet per round in any direction. If you have more than one target, each target moves in the same direction and distance. Impact with objects while floating causes no damage, and solid obstacles, such as a wall, simply prevent movement in that direction. A target can’t be lifted higher than 20 feet normally, and should a target be moved over a sudden drop, it will safely fall the difference until it is back to 20 feet above a surface.</p>
            <p class="indent">The affected creature can only move by pushing or pulling against fixed surfaces (such as a wall or ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to increase the maximum lift height by 10 feet for every additional 4 power points you spend.</p>

            <p>Your will summons an invisible force that can hold you aloft. You may use this power as a reaction if you are falling.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this power is in effect, you can use your reaction to stop yourself from falling. You can safely descend up to 30 feet per round using your movement.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You levitate yourself, floating off the ground. You can move up to 20 feet in any direction each round as part of your movement action, but can go no higher than 60 feet from a surface. If you move over a cliff, you will safely fall until you are no more than 60 feet above a surface.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> This power’s range increases to 60 feet, allowing you to target a creature or object of Large size or smaller. You control your target’s movement as augmentations allow. A creature must be willing or the power fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, increasing the range by 30 feet for every 2 additional power points you spend.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augmentation to affect a creature or object of any size provided it weighs no more than 2,000 pounds by spending an additional 6 power points (8). You can further enhance this empowerment to increase the maximum weight by 1,000 pounds per 2 more power points spent. If an augmentation has other size or weight restrictions, those limits apply to that particular augmentation’s effects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You can telekinetically thrust your way through water, granting you an effective swimming speed of 30 feet. You are resistant to gusts of wind and strong water currents. Any environmental feature or special effect that would force you to make a saving throw to stay aloft or afloat, you make with advantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending 2 additional power points (5) to gain the ability to fly. Your flight speed is 60 feet and you can hover.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> Increase the speed you can move from this power by 10 feet. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> You can affect one additional creature of Large size or smaller within 5 feet of you (or your target if you augment this power to have a range). You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent">The affected target remains next to you and can’t move independently as a function of this power. If at any point the target strays more than 15 feet from you, the power will no longer affect it.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can opt to bring along objects in place of a creature, lifting 500 pounds of objects instead of one creature. Multiple objects in place of one creature must occupy a 5-foot cube. A single object must be Large sized or smaller. A creature or object standing on a lifted creature or object counts against its weight limit. If exceeded, the power will fail.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> While aloft, you can make a special attack action: psychokinetic dive.</p>
            <p class="indent">Psychokinetic dive is an action that shrouds you within a telekinetic field. You pick a spot along a surface and fly at high speed, impacting that spot. You can move an additional 40 feet as part of the attack, provided the extra movement is in a straight line toward your impact point. Each creature within 5 feet of your impact point must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage. If the save is successful, the creature takes half damage. You suffer no damage from this attack and don’t provoke reactions by a creature struck if you use any of your remaining movement to move away. Psychokinetic dive counts as an energy power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>13.</i></b> You can telekinetically lift a surface and everything on it within a 10-foot radius sphere centered on you. You can move the entire mass with a flying speed of 100 feet in place of your normal movement. Each creature and object on the mass you lift is carried with you and doesn’t suffer gravity, treating the lifted mass as its center of gravity.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to allow you to use your reaction to rotate the mass in order to grant full cover against any attack from that direction. For example, while flying a mass of earth in a battle against a red dragon, the manifester can use the lifted earth to block the dragon’s breath attack, treating each creature and object upon it as having full cover. This empowerment costs an additional 4 power points (17).</p>

            <p>You create bands of telekinetic force that allow you to grasp targets. Each creature you target must make a Strength saving throw at the start of each of its turn to overcome the effects and act normally for the round. This power’s effects will never force a target creature to fail its saving throw against this power. If the target is teleported, becomes incorporeal, or moves to another plane of existence, it is no longer affected by this power.</p>
            <p class="indent">You create an inhibiting force against a creature of Medium size or smaller. If the creature fails its saving throw, its movement speed is reduced by half and it can’t take the Dash action.</p>
            <p class="indent">Alternately, you can place a telekinetic hold on an object occupying a space no larger than a 5-foot cube. Any attempt to move that object requires a Strength check against your power save DC. The object is considered latched to a surface.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> Each creature which fails its saving throw is at disadvantage on melee weapon damage rolls.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> You can target one additional creature or object, provided each target is within 30 feet of each other. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You restrain a creature that fails its saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>4.</i></b> You can target a creature of Large size or smaller or an object no larger than a 10-foot cube.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to affect a creature of Huge size or smaller by spending an additional 6 power points (10).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You paralyze a creature that fails its saving throw. The creature can’t be moved by normal means while this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to suffocate the creature by spending an additional 8 power points (15). So long as you continue to maintain this power, the creature will choke, falling to 0 hit points after a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1) as defined under suffocation rules (chapter 8 in the Player’s Handbook). If your target is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to outright kill it.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Detection: Psychic, Gesture</p>
            <p>You project thoughts and feelings to a creature to send a short message (that can be conveyed in a 6-second round) to a single target in range. To transmit verbal information, your target must share a common language. You can also transmit intense emotion, such as danger or safety, allowing you to target a creature incapable of language.</p>
            <p class="indent">When used against an unwilling creature, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. If this save is successful, the creature is unaffected and the power ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">So long as this power is in effect, you can continue to transmit information with your target during your turn without using an action. You may use your bonus action to change the target of this power, ending the effect on the previous target.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You attempt to impose a thought or feeling on your target. If it fails its saving throw, it immediately thinks the same thought or feels that feeling. The creature won’t take any action that could cause it harm, but can be impressed to take some innocuous action, such as visiting a location to do something. How the creature reacts to a projected thought or emotion is up to its normal pattern of behavior.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to relieve a creature of a feeling, such as anger or grief, by spending an additional 4 power points (5). This can suppress the frightened and unsettled conditions as well as the effects of a psychic impression. It has no effect on a barbarian’s Rage feature or spells such as heroism.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>2.</i></b> Your contact becomes aware of the link with you, and as a bonus action, can mentally send you thoughts and feelings.</p>
            <p class="indent">The subject doesn’t have to respond to you if it does not wish.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You target an additional creature in range. You can take this augmentation multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>6.</i></b> You increase the range of this power to cross any distance to telepathically connect with a creature you know. You can only use this augmentation to transmit thoughts and feelings, not to alter them.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation to allow you to connect with a creature you know on another plane of existence by spending an additional 4 power points (10).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>7.</i></b> You adjust a creature’s mood toward you or another known creature. If the creature fails it saving throw, it can be made to be either friendly or hostile if it is indifferent or become indifferent if it is hostile or friendly.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you change the mood of a creature towards you, you also gain advantage on social ability checks made against that creature, such as Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>9.</i></b> You send clear thoughts and concepts that your recipient understands even without sharing a common language. For example, you could send your contact a mental picture of a trap so it can avoid it, or share information about something you’ve recently learned. Communications must be able to fit within one round. Longer, more detailed correspondence will take multiple rounds to convey.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>11.</i></b> Sending a compulsion of nonviolence and serenity, you calm one creature and prevent it from attacking or to cease attacking if already in combat. The creature will take no offensive action if it fails its saving throw, but will still defend itself. If any aggressive action is taken against the target, the effect immediately ends, and the creature can act normally.</p>
            <p class="indent">This power will suppress features and effects such as Rage, Bardic Inspiration, and heroism, as well fear and confusion effects. When this power ends, such effects will resume unless their durations have expired in the meantime.</p>

Once per round while this power remains in effect, when the creature takes damage from any source it must make a Wisdom saving throw or relive the trauma.

            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> Targets knocked prone by this power take 2d6 force damage.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> Each square of surface you hit with this power causes the earth to explode. Each creature standing on the square that fails its saving throw takes a 3d6 bludgeoning damage. If it succeeds its saving thing it takes half this damage.</p>

            <p class="indent">If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation by spending an additional 4 power points (13) to create a fissure along your effect area. The fissure is 50 feet deep. Each creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save fails, the creature falls into the fissure and takes fall damage. Each object that has at least half of its mass in the path also falls in the fissure.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this power is in effect, you can use your action cause an existing fissure to collapse dealing 10d6 bludgeoning damage to any target within.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You cause a light rain or snow to fall. Each creature within the area gains advantage on saving throws against fire and the rains will extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower the strength of the rain by spending 4 additional power points to create heavy rains. A heavy rain will douse a 5-foot cube of flame on each source of fire and each creature within the area gains resistance to fire.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>1.</i></b> You create an eye in your storm anywhere within your effect area. This eye is a 5-foot diameter.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, increasing the diameter of your eye by 5 feet per additional power point spent to do so.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>3.</i></b> You summon gusts of wind creating a line 60 feet long and 10 feet wide anywhere within the effect area that blasts from a direction you choose. Each creature that starts its turn in a line must succeed a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the direction of the wind. Any creature within a line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves while moving against the wind. The winds disperse gas or vapors, and extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. Protected flames dance wildly and have a 50 percent chance to be extinguished. You may take a bonus action to reposition one line of wind while this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">You may take a bonus action to reposition one line of wind while this power remains in effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, adding an additional line of wind for every power point spent this way. Overlapping wind works in each direction of the line of wind.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You create a sleet storm that affects a 20-foot tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point within your effect area that you choose. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. If a creature starts its turn in the storm and is concentrating on a spell or power, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your power save DC or lose concentration.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can take a bonus action to move one storm’s point of origin anywhere within the effect area so long as this power remains in effect. When you move a storm, the area under it remains difficult terrain for 2 rounds.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation, creating an additional cylinder of sleet for every additional 2 power points you spend.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also empower this augmentation to transform your sleet into a mix of snow and hail by spending an additional 4 power points (9). Each creature that starts its turn within your hail storm must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save is failed, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage, and it is knocked prone. If the save is successful, the creature suffers half damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You take control of the air in effect area. During your turn, while this power remains in effect, you can change the intensity of the wind to calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that enter or leave the effect area or pass through it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, the entire area acts as a gust in one direction. Each creature that starts its turn within the effect area must succeed a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the direction of the wind. Any creature within the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves while moving against the wind. The winds disperse gas or vapors, and extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. Protected flames dance wildly and have a 50 percent chance to be extinguished.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> You can create a downdraft or an updraft in the effect area.</p>
            <p class="indent">A downdraft is a sustained blast of strong wind that blows down from the top area. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the area or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there while flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked to the ground and is rendered prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">An updraft is a sustained wind from the area’s bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from a fall. When a creature in the area makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>5.</i></b> By taking a bonus action, you may call on one lightning bolt to strike any point within the effect area. Each creature within 5 feet of where a lightning bolt strikes must make a Dexterity saving throw. If the save fails, it takes 3d6 lightning damage. If the save is successful, the creature takes half damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can empower this augmentation increasing the lightning damage by 1d6 per 2 additional power points spent up to 10 power points.</p>
