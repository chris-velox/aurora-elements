            <p>A monk following the Way of Insight has opened its mind to greater spiritual awareness and can tap its inner soul to manifest psionic powers. Such a monk’s ki flows freely between mind, body, and soul.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to manifest psionic powers.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Powers Known.</i></b> You know one power of your choice from the psion power list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Powers Known column of the Way of Insight table shows when you learn more psion powers of your choice. Unlike spell casting classes, you may not replace powers when you gain levels in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Power Points.</i></b> The Way of Insight table shows how many power points you have to augment your psion powers. When you manifest a power, you can expend power points to enhance your power. You can expend a number of power points no greater than one third your your monk level on a single power. You regain all expended power points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">Psionic powers differ from spells in that powers can have different expressions when augmented by power points. These different expressions have a similar theme, but the scope and scale can change. For example, the suspension power includes expressions that can affect single targets or an area with different measures of control.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Manifesting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your manifesting ability for your powers.</p>
                <p class="indent">You use Wisdom whenever a power refers to your manifesting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psion power you manifest and when making an attack roll.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Power save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Power attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
