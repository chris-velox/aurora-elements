        <description>
            <p>Moving at unnatural speed, a human bobs and weaves around the battlefield as an ogre moves to cut her off. In a blink she phases through the ogre, her eyes narrowing as she focuses on its warlock master trying to take refuge behind cover. She smirks as she strikes the air in front of her, but instead of her blade striking the air it strikes the flank of the warlock.</p>
            <p class="indent">A dwarf drops down from the top of the mausoleum as a priest runs, by pursued by a wraith. Whirling his axes, he strikes the wraith and signals his allies. Arrows fly, plunging into the wraith as if it were made of flesh and bone.</p>
            <p class="indent">Standing before a halfling is the armor-clad champion of the dragon cult. With but a thought, a blade of pure mental energy forms from the halfling’s fist and in that moment the fight begins. Landing a singular striking, the halfling smirks as he releases psionic energy that stagger’s his opponent.</p>
            <p class="indent">Uniting all psychic warriors is a discipline forged from hammering its will to its purpose. Whether a spirit hunter or an exemplar athlete, each psychic warrior leverages maintained powers to amplify training.</p>
            <h4>MARTIAL DISCIPLINE</h4>
            <p>Many warriors make a study of the martial disciplines of arms, armor, and tactics, but some warriors opt to delve into esoteric studies to reach states of altered consciousness and bend matter to their will. Psychic warriors are such students, becoming adepts to psychically enhancing their physical performance.</p>
            <h4>CONTEMPLATIVE STUDY</h4>
            <p>Controlling the forces of the spiritual and the mental is not a fast or simple task. Rather it is one that requires immense levels of focus and discipline. Psychic warriors frequently practice their psionic and martial arts with zeal matched only by the most consummate knights and dedicated fighters. For psychic warriors, it is imperative to have focused minds that seamlessly operate with vigorous movement.</p>
            <p class="indent">Many psychic warriors recognize that simply studying or sequestering themselves away in cloisters will do little to push them in enhancing their powers. As such, they often seek to become adventurers to hone their skills and shape their minds into fine weapons</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PSYCHIC WARRIOR</h4>
            <p>When creating your psychic warrior, consider what drove your character to merge martial training with psionic discipline. Was there an event in your past where you felt powerless with the tools available which compelled you to pursue more mystical means? Are you a polymath of martial feats that needed a further edge or challenge?</p>
            <p class="indent">As a psychic warrior, you are able to support your group with talents similar to fighters and psions. You can readily fill roles like a fighter or paladin, but can also opt to focus yourself to be more like a rogue. While you won’t gain your Eclectic Attunement until 3rd level, you want to consider what choice you wish to make when deciding skills and how to prioritize your abilities as well as which powers are best suited for you. If you see your character as an armored defender you’ll probably choose powers that are defensive and give you more battlefield control. For a character that rapidly strikes enemies you’ll want movement or ranged powers. A ranged psychic warrior or an assassin themed one would choose different powers.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a psychic warrior quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score depending on whether you want finesse weapons or not, followed by Wisdom. Second choose the soldier background. Third choose speed of thought as your known power.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

			<description>
				<p>At 1st level, you have can harness your psychic aptitude to manifest psionic powers.</p>
				<h5>POWERS KNOWN</h5>
				<p>You know one power of your choice from the psychic warrior power list.</p>
				<p class="indent">The Powers Known column of the Psychic Warrior table shows when you learn more psychic warrior powers of your choice. Unlike spell casting classes, you may not replace powers when you gain levels in this class.</p>
				<h5>POWER POINTS</h5>
				<p>The Psychic Warrior table shows how many power points you have to augment your psychic warrior powers. When you manifest a power, you can expend power points to enhance your power. You can expend a number of power points no greater than half your psychic warrior level on a single power. You regain all expended power points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
				<p class="indent">Psionic powers differ from spells in that powers can have different expressions when augmented by power points. These different expressions have a similar theme, but the scope and scale can change. For example, the suspension power includes expressions that can affect single targets or an area with different measures of control.</p>
				<h5>MANIFESTING ABILITY</h5>
				<p>Wisdom is your manifesting ability for your powers.</p>
				<p class="indent">You use Wisdom whenever a power refers to your manifesting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psychic warrior power you manifest and when making an attack roll.</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Power save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Power attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

			<p>Ghost hunters are individuals who stalk the supernatural, often as part of a deep-rooted vendetta. They seek out and destroy ghosts, disembodied spirits, and incorporeal undead. They are restless pursuers of spirits and undead creatures, leaning toward unhealthy obsession in their drive to obliterate the creatures. Ghost hunters will spend time tracking their quarry and setting up a trap to destroy it. Their attitudes often brush others the wrong way, and most ghost hunters are loners by nature.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many ghost hunters suffered tragedy at the hand of supernatural forces, driving them on their crusade against spiritual undead and similar fiends. The past of the typical ghost hunter is often tragic, and depression hovers over the hunter like early morning fog to a swamp.</p>

Twice per rest you can take a bonus action to empower any melee weapon (or unarmed attack) you possess for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum of 1). This grants the weapon the following features so long as it remains in your possession:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>You are able to strike any creature you can perceive in the Ethereal Plane as if it were in your current plane of existence.</li>

You can freely intersperse melee and ranged attacks as part of the same Attack action if you are manifesting a raw mind blade and not imbuing a normal weapon. Raw mind blade ranged attacks aren’t made with disadvantage if used within 5 feet of a hostile creature like a normal ranged attack would be.</p>

If you use an imbued weapon, its normal damage is not dealt, instead replaced with the raw mind blade damage.</p>
