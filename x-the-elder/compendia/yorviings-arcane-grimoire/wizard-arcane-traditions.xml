            <p>You are a wizard who focuses on the study of sound, and tries to understand the nature of sound waves and vibrations that are present in all things. Followers of this tradition of Acoustics, often called Acousticians or Sound Sages, often prefer spells that can manipulate sound, and believe that all things have a ‘perfect harmony’ that they aim to tune themselves to, and that the incorrect vibrations within the heart or soul can lead to imbalance. Many of these wizards are musicians, avid linguists, or public speakers, but can also be found in unique roles within a military, or trying to mold the earth with the power of sound and vibrations.</p>

                <p>Starting at 2nd level, you have learned how to affect a creature’s center of balance by manipulating sound. As an action, choose a number of creatures that you can see within 10 feet of you. If the target can hear you, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your wizard spell save DC or be deafened until the end of your next turn, as you emit a noise that discombobulates it. Each deafened creature’s speed drops to 0, and each creature drops any items or objects that it is carrying.</p>
                <p class="indent">On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect, extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can’t use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>There exist a handful of wizards who believe that there exists a fifth element, wood, that stands alongside the traditional elements of fire, air, earth, and water. Known as arbormancers or wood mages, these wizards view wood as embodying warmth, cooperation, and strength, and favor spells that incorporate wood. Many of these wizards study in forests, sometimes working alongside druids or fey.</p>

            <p>The esoteric tradition of Cartomancy is an approach to magic where followers utilize elements of the existing schools of magic in order to produce unique effects of fortune and trickery. Spells associated with Cartomancy are all cast via the use of playing cards, and often take on the appearance of cards or card suits.</p>
            <p class="indent">Followers of this tradition, known as ‘card mages’, can divine fate through cards and create unique effects by imbuing cards with magic, though the magic can be beneficial or dangerous, making card mages gamble with the fate of the cards.</p>

                <p>At 2nd level, you learn how to infuse cards with magic for unique effects, though the cards may not always lean in your favor. Whenever you cast a spell with the cartomancy tag that has a casting time of one action, you can draw one playing card as a bonus action. The card’s rank determines the magical effect as shown on the Card Rank Table, and the card’s suit determines who the effect can target as shown on the Card Suit Table. The effect takes place immediately, and the card is then put at the bottom of your deck. If you do not have a set of playing cards, you can roll a d4 on the Card Suit Table to determine the card’s suit, and a d12 on the Card Rank Table to determine its rank.</p>
                <p class="indent">You draw one additional card at 6th, 10th, and 14th level, choosing which card takes effect when you do so. Note: If you do not have a deck of 52 cards, you can roll on the tables below to produce the same effects, rolling a d12 and d4, respectively. You would not roll for the Joker card.</p>

Once per turn, whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher on a willing creature, they can move up to half their movement speed (no action required). Alternatively, if you cast such a spell on an unwilling creature, and you hit the creature with that spells’ attack or the creature fails that spell’s saving throw, you can forcibly move the creature up to half of their movement speed to an unoccupied space.</p>

            <p>The incredibly rare tradition known as Doomsaying involves the art of seeing into the future to witness the ending of one’s self, others, or a kingdom itself. Wizards who follow this tradition are known as doomsayers, and are those who dared to expose themselves to the dreaded knowledge of divining the future to wield the magic of final moments. Some wizards who practice this tradition witness the end and see it as a way of knowing how much time is left to make a difference in the world, while others see it as a true source of power as they know how and when their enemies will crumble into dust.</p>

Whenever you deal damage to a creature with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your bonus action to draw some of their blood to you to consume, though creatures that do not have blood are immune to this effect. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Blood Resevoir:</strong> You consume the life force of the creature. You regain hit points equal to half of the amount of damage dealt to the creature from your spell, and your hit point maximum increases by the same amount. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Bloodshape:</strong> You consume the essence of the creature. Until you finish a long rest, you can use your action to change your appearance to be that of the creature for up to 4 hours. Your statistics remain the same, but your size changes to be that of the creature, and you gain any of the creature’s special speeds or senses. You have advantage on Charisma checks made to pass yourself off as the creature for the duration.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Blood Defense:</strong> You consume the strength of the creature. Until you finish a long rest, you gain one damage resistance or condition immunity that the creature had.</p>

            <p>Pyromancy is the art of creating and controlling flame, channeling the fire within the body to create powerful magic. Pyromancers study the flames they can wield, viewing this fire as an extension of their own selves, either as manifestations of anger, love, passion, or as a holy gift. Preferring spells of flame and ash, some Pyromancers use their knowledge of fire to work as fire breathers or dancers, battlemages in holy armies, blacksmiths, or as sinister arsonists.</p>

You can affect the molecular structure of creatures and objects, and call upon the untapped power within the smallest parts of the universe. The magic you can wield makes you incredibly powerful, allowing you to bend matter and energy to your will.</p>
            <p class="indent">Known as quantumurgists or ‘quantum mages’, these wizards can be leading experts regarding physics and the ways in which magic, the Weave, and the universe all interconnect with one another, given their incredible knowledge of mathematical properties and physics. Others seek the raw and unfathomable power that quantumurgy can bring, hoping to master this dangerous and unusual school of magic in order to control its unique power.</p>
            <p class="indent">Note: This Arcane Tradition uses a new school of magic called ’quantumurgy’, the details of which are listed in Part 5 of this compendium.</p>

                <p>By 6th level, you have learned how to cause a creature to remember a spell that it had cast upon it. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature is unwilling, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. On a failed save, or if the creature is willing, it experiences one spell of your choice that affected it within the past day. The spell must have been cast by you or a creature that is friendly to you, and you must have seen the creature be affected by the spell in order to choose it. The creature then magically remembers what it experienced under the effects of that spell, and it begins to experience spell’s effects as if it had just been cast on them again. A spell with a duration longer than 1 round lasts until the end of the creature’s next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per long rest.</p>

These wizards, known as ’Stormsingers’, develop a unique form of magic known as the ’Stormsong’, which grants them strength against lightning and thunder, as well as increased speed. Followers of this tradition often find peace and solitude in the presence of mighty tempests and gales, living in areas with where they occur frequently as they continue studying their behavior and perfecting the art of the Stormsong.</p>

Followers of this tradition are usually, found out near or on the seas, aiding ships in smooth sailing and helping to explore uncharted territories, often singing. It is not uncommon to see these wizards befriend some druids or storm sorcerers, or even see Tidecallers commanding ships or fleets themselves.</p>

When you cast <em>investiture of wind</em> in this way, while the spell is active, creatures of your choice up to your Intelligence modifier within a 20-foot radius of you also gain a flying speed of 60 feet as long as you maintain concentration on the spell. If you or an ally land before the spell ends, you or your ally take no falling damage and can land on their feet.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you cast <em>investiture of wind</em> in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, though you can still cast it normally using an available spell slot.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Before the times of prestigious magical institutions and universities, there were those who first discovered the arts of the arcane, in its raw and primal form. These wizards were the herald for a magical tradition known as Witchcraft. The wizards and witches who follow this tradition hone their magical skills through the acquisition of unique magics called Crafts, and later Grand Crafts, as well as learning spells the usual wizard would not be able to. Many who study the tradition of Witchcraft can be seen as either guides and village elders, or as sinister and dark practitioners of the arcane. However, while some places may be more accepting to students of witchcraft, other established universities or regions may have a much more demeaning view of these magical practitioners, even going so far as to hunt them down.</p>

                <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you enter into a Coven, which helps to define what special field of witchcraft you adhere to. Your Coven grants you special abilities, one of which is the acquisition of many spells normally not known to the wizards who follow other magical traditions. Choose one of the following Covens:</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Black Magic</strong> <em>(focuses on curses, toying with the minds of others, and the dead).</em> <strong>Bard &amp; Warlock</strong> - enchantment, evocation, necromancy</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Green Magic</strong> <em>(focuses on aspects of nature, such as the elements, animals, and plantlife).</em> <strong>Druid</strong> - conjuration, divination, transmutation</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>White Magic</strong> <em>(focuses on healing, medicine, and divine or heavenly qualities of both life and the world).</em> <strong>Cleric</strong> - abjuration, divination, transmutation</p>
                <p class="indent">You learn one cantrip of your choice from a Class associated with your Coven. Whenever you gain a wizard level, you can replace one of the wizard spells you add to your spellbook with a spell from your Coven’s associated class, so long as it belongs to the schools associated with that coven. These spells are known as your Coven spells. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Any Coven spell you gain from this feature is considered a wizard spell for you, and you can cast them using a wizard spell slot, but other wizards can’t copy Coven spells from your Grimoire into their own spellbooks, and any wizard feature that utilizes a spellbook does not utilize an Arcane Grimoire.</p>
