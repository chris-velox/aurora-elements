            <p>You imbue a playing card with arcane energy before throwing it towards a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can create more than one magically imbued card when you reach higher levels - two cards at 5th level, three cards at 11th level, and four cards at 17th level. You can direct the cards at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each card.</p>

While the target is cursed, you can use your bonus action to deal 1d6 lightning damage and 1d6 necrotic damage to it automatically. This curse ends early if you use your bonus action to do anything else, or if the target has total cover from you. A remove curse spell also ends this curse’s effects.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Calling upon the magic of Carceri, you conjure forth a length of chain composed of solidified energy in your hand. This magic chain lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit and has the heavy and reach properties. In addition, whenever you successfully hit a target with the chain, you can cause the chain’s length to extend to wrap around the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw, becoming grappled on a failed save. This effect lasts until the creature breaks free, you are reduced to 0 hit points, you attempt to move away from the target.</p>
            <p class="indent">To break out of the chain, the grappled target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the chain.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you drop the weapon, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the chain to reappear in your hand.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the damage increases to 3d8. When you cast it using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the damage increases to 4d8. When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases to 5d8.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You curse a creature to suffer from a minor, harmful effect. Choose a creature within range. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, and creatures who cannot be charmed are immune to this spell. On a failed save, the creature suffers from one of the following effects of your choice for 1 minute:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>This Really Itches:</strong> The creature suffers from an insatiable itch that covers their entire body. While under this curse, the affected creature must spend its bonus action to scratch at its body. Constructs and undead are immune to this curse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Um, Say What?:</strong> The creature loses the ability to speak clearly, with their words becoming jumbled or out of order. While under this curse, the affected creature has disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks, and cannot be understood by others, and becomes visibly frustrated when it cannot be understood. Creatures who cannot speak are immune to this curse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Please Shut Up:</strong> The creature loses the ability to be quiet, and cannot speak in anything other than a loud voice or scream. While under this curse, the affected creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, is incapable of whispering, and must announce its actions as it is performing them, as if narrating their own life. Creatures who cannot speak are immune to this curse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Argh, My Eye!:</strong> The creature swears that something is in its eye, and whatever it is causes an irritating feeling. While under this curse, the affected creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, their vision becomes blurry, and they must use a free action to rub at their eye. Creatures without organic eyes or without eyes are immune to this curse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Who Hurt You?:</strong> The creature becomes compelled to tell others about their life and feelings in a either a sad, angry, or melancholy manner (the choice of which is up to the DM). While under this curse, the affected creature must roll 1d6 at the beginning of its turn. On an odd number, the creature begins telling others that can hear it about terrible events that have happened to it throughout its life. On an even number, the creature begins telling others about how it is currently feeling, or how its feelings towards another creature or place. Other creatures have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made against the creature. Creatures who cannot speak are immune to this curse.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Please Love Me:</strong> The creature falls maddeningly in love with one creature that it can see within 30 feet of it. While under this curse, the affected creature can not target the creature that it loves with an attack or spell, and must instead choose one other creature that it can see within range of the attack or spell, insisting that this second creature is trying to steal the first creature’s love away from them. Constructs and undead are immune to this curse.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature under one of these curses can attempt to break free from it by repeating the Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of each of its turns.</p>

            <p>This spell repairs a single mechanical device or contraption you touch, such as a broken engine, a clock, a stuck lever, or a metal prosthetic, so long as you have a part of the device to be repaired. As long as the break or malfunction is no larger than 5 feet in any dimension, you repair it, leaving no trace of the former damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.</p>

            <p>Using strands of starlight, you conjure a longbow of solidified glowing energy in your hand. This magic bow lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 radiant damage on a hit, and has the ammunition and two-handed properties (range 150/600). In addition, when you use the bow to attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, each creature within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 radiant damage, as the arrow explodes like a dying star.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.</p>

            <p>You attempt to invoke the unique movement of a target at the atomic level. Choose a target within range to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s form begins to shift rapidly, blurring in a rapid movement. At the beginning of each subsequent turn for the spell’s duration, the target is randomly teleported 30 feet to an unoccupied space in a direction determined by rolling on the following table.</p>

            <p>You cut yourself on the arm or chest to create a sword of solidified blood and iron in your hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d8 necrotic damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and thrown properties (range 20/60). In addition, when you use the sword to attack a target that is below its hit point maximum, you regain hit points equal to half of the damage dealt. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the sword to reappear in your hand.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the damage increases to 3d8. When you cast it using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the damage increases to 4d8. When you cast it using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases to 5d8.</p>

On impact the bottle explodes and the area in a 10-foot radius around the point is filled with alcoholic fog. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw.

            <p>This spell creates an mechanical construct servant. Your spell transforms the material components with a surge of artificial life and electricity, raising it as a construct creature. The target becomes a animated armor (the DM has the creature’s game statistics).</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any animated armor you made with this spell if it is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain the control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p>

Constructs made from spells (such as animate objects) or who are animated (such as animated armor) must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC when entering the affected area, or become inactive until the beginning of their next turn on a failed save.</p>

            <p>Drawing three cards, you announce a declaration that you will attempt before the beginning of your next turn in combat, hoping to accomplish. The declaration must be spoken aloud, and must be made clear to the intent. Any declaration made is interpreted by word of declaration, not by intent of declaration. If a declaration listed below refers to a target, you must declare who the target is, and your choice cannot change once declared.</p>
            <p class="indent">A declaration can be one of the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reducing a target to 0 hit points.</li>
                <li>Successfully hitting a target with a ranged spell attack.</li>
                <li>Successfully hitting a target with a melee spell attack.</li>
                <li>Casting a spell at a target who then fails a saving throw against the spell.</li>
                <li>You do not take any damage during this round of combat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You can also make a declaration that is not listed in the above examples. If you choose to do so, state your declaration to the DM as precisely as possible.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your declaration is accomplished, you regain one 1st-level spell slot. If your declaration is not accomplished, you lose one 1st-level spell slot. If you cannot regain or lose a 1st-level spell slot, you instead regain or lose 2d8 hit points.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure up three 1-inch thick glowing planetary rings around you, that constantly rotate and spin at slow speeds. The rings float around you, occupying space. When a creature enters the area of one of the rings for the first time or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 radiant damage on a failed save and is pushed back 10 feet, or half as much damage on a successful one. The outermost ring then dissipates into dust.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase or decrease the radius of the outermost ring from you by 5 feet, to a maximum of 15 feet away from you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create one additional ring for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>You transform your exposed blood into hardened iron that protects your skin. When you first cast this spell, if you have taken damage, your AC increases by 1, so long as you are not wearing armor or carrying a shield. While this spell is active, once per round when you take damage and successfully maintain concentration on this spell, your blood hardens to grant you an additional +1 to your AC. Each time you must roll to maintain concentration on this spell, you subtract from the roll an amount equal to the AC bonus you have received from this spell, as the blood loss strains the body. When this spell ends, the hardened iron on your body breaks into dust, and your AC returns to normal.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell ends if you begin wearing any armor or use a shield.</p>

The spell brings to your mind a brief analysis of the local customs, accent, dialect, beliefs, and behaviors of the local culture. This information might consist of slang words or phrases, what gods or deities are worshipped and why, mannerisms and gestures that the local populace act out or avoid, or the preferred clothing style or choice of food.</p>

If you are a native to the culture, you gain additional knowledge that you would not have already known. For the spells Duration, you have advantage on Charisma checks to pass yourself off as one of the locals of the country. A suspicious creature can make a Wisdom (Insight) check at disadvantage to ascertain your true nature and identity. On a success, the creature knows you’re trying to impersonate a native of the country.</p>

            <p>You deconstruct your body at the atomic level, causing you to disappear in a quick cloud of fine grey dust. You can move up to 100 feet, and you can pass through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Doing so does not provoke opportunity attacks against you. If the object you pass through would normally cause damage, such as a wall of fire, you take no damage when passing through it. You take 6d6 force damage if you end your turn inside an object or creature. Once you arrive at an unoccupied space of your choice, you materialize into your normal form.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure forth a healthy, beautiful pig at an unoccupied space within range. As soon as the pig is summoned, it begins either speaking or singing. If it speaks, it tells terrible jokes or bad advice. If it sings, it sings off key and off tempo. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of the pig becomes visibly distracted, and has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of your next turn. At the end of your next turn, the pig disappears in a puff of smoke.</p>
            <p class="indent">The pig is impervious to all damage and cannot be targeted by any spell aside from the dispel magic spell. The pig is also immune to all conditions, cannot perform any other action aside from speaking or singing, and any attempt to convince it that its jokes, advice, or singing is wrong or terrible automatically fail.</p>

It emits bright light out to 15 feet and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Additionally, creatures and objects can pass through it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall is 1 inch thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-15-foot cards. Each card must be contiguous with at least one other card. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot cards that are 3 inches thick.</p>

However, whenever a creature or object passes through the wall, it must make another Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature begins choking and must spend its action that turn fetching and reeling.</p>
            <p class="indent">A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the wall after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p>

            <p>A translucent wall of sound appears at a point you choose within range. The wall emits a faint humming noise, however should a creature or object touch the wall, the wall bursts into a loud, vibrating noise that lasts for a few seconds after it has been touched. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever a creature or object touches the wall, it must make a Constitution saving throw, or take 6d8 thunder damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. Creatures who fail their saving throws are deafened until the beginning of their next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage though both the dispel magic and silence spells can dispel it.</p>

Each subsequent time you do so, the necrotic damage increases by an additional 1d8, to a maximum of 9d8. However, the pain from the rune begins to take hold. Each time you fire off another blast after the initial one, you take 1d8 necrotic damage. This necrotic damage ignores resistance and immunity, but doesn’t force you to make Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration.</p>

            <p>An invisible wall of pulsating energy conjures into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 20 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 20-foot-by-20-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side), and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 8d6 force damage, or half as much on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by <em>dispel magic</em>. If a creature casts the <em>disintegrate</em> spell or a quantumurgy spell that deals force damage against the wall, you must make a Constitution saving throw for the wall, ignoring any advantage or disadvantage you might have on the roll. On a failed save, the wall vanished. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A nonmagical wall of flesh, faces, and limbs conjures into existence at a point you choose within range. Each face in the wall constantly moans or screams in pain. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot sections of flesh and meat. Each section must be contiguous with at least on other panel, stitched together. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot sections that are only 3 inches thick.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). The inner part of the wall is smoothed skin, while the outer part of the wall consists of moving arms, lets, and faces embedded into the wall. If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or resting on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing ground. Thus you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each section to create supports.</p>
            <p class="indent">The wall is an object made of flesh that can be damaged and thus breached. Each section has AC 14 and 40 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to tear from each other at the DM’s discretion.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever a creature begins their turn or moves within 10 feet of the outer part of the wall, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the wall grabs the creature, and the creature is restrained. A creature can use their action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. While a creature is restrained, you can use your bonus action to cause the hands or faces in the wall to hit or bite into the creature, dealing 3d8 bludgeoning and 3d8 piercing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature with flesh dies from an attack made by the wall, that creature’s body is absorbed and added into the wall.</p>

            <p>You create a wall of strong, durable, moving trunks of wood adorned in thick branches, leaves, and roots. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and is 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature can move through the wall, albeit sloly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 blugeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure forth a massive cannon in a 15-foot-by-15-foot cube in an unoccupied area that you can see. The cannon is visibly magical, and ethereal streaks of arcane energy weave around it. The cannon then emits a low, audible hum that reverberates throughout the ground extending 15 feet from the cannon. Choose one damage type from acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. A blast of the appropriate damage type forming a line of 500 feet and 15 feet wide fires out from the cannon’s barrel. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 12d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures who fail their saving throw are also pushed back 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">The type of damage also affects the area. Fire and lightning ignite flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. Cold covers objects in the area in a layer of frost. Acid and poison cover objects in the area a layer of acidic and poisonous liquid. Thunder makes objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried fly back 60 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell deals double damage against structures.</p>

The area of each cannon consists of a 20-foot cube, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cannon fires a blast forming a line of 1,000 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts out from the cannon’s barrel in a direction you choose. You can choose a different direction for each cannon.

The ship and any pieces of the ship, such as parts of the hull, sails, masts, railing, and more begin to float to the surface, if it is submerged in water, otherwise the ship and pieces of the ship begin reconstructing themselves together. During this rebuilding, rotten or destroyed wood transforms into new wood, and torn sails repair themselves. This spell repairs any containers, ropes, or windows that are necessary for the ship’s travel and functionality, though this spell does not restore any cargo that the ship was carrying at the time it was shipwrecked.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes on the form of a beast of CR 5 or lower. The familiar appears in an unoccupied space within range, and the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is considered a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, the familiar rolls its own initiative and acts on its own. A familiar can attack and take other actions as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent">The familiar also gains the following benefits: the familiar’s Intelligence score increases to 14, if it is lower, the familiar gains a name of its choice, and the familiar is able to speak and read every language that the caster is able to speak, read, and write. The familiar cannot write unless it has the appendages to do so. The familiar gains a basic personality, and its consciousness is always summoned into the new form whenever this spell is cast. The familiar can also interact with objects in a manner that makes logical sense to its form.</p>
            <p class="indent">The familiar is also able to attune to one magic item at a time, and this item appears and disappears with it when it is summoned or dismissed. If you dismiss your familiar forever, the item is returned to you.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears in a puff of smoke, leaving behind no physical form, and it reappears after you cast this spell again. While your familiar is on the same plane of existence as you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar, with the familiar disappearing into a pocket dimension where it awaits you to summon it. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. While it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can’t have more than on familiar at any given time. If you have a familiar already by means of the find familiar spell, you must dismiss the familiar granted by the find familiar spell. You can only have the familiar from find familiar or from this spell active at a time, and you cannot have both. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms of a beast of CR 5 or lower. The familiar then transforms into the new chosen form.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch or a spell with a range of 30 feet or less, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 150 feet of you to do so, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll, and if the spell requires a saving throw, you use your spell save DC for the spell.</p>

It deals 3d10 force damage on a hit and has the versatile properties, and the staff deals an extra 1d10 force damage on when wielded with two hands. In addition, for the spell’s duration, while the staff is in your hand your movement speed and jump height are doubled, and you can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you drop the weapon, it vanishes at the end of the turn. Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to cause the wooden rod to reappear in your hand before growing back into a full quarterstaff.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure a nine-story tower made of crystal, ivory, stone, wood, or similar suitably sturdy materials. This spell immediately fails if there is not enough room for the tower. The tower can be round, square, or triangular in shape. Each level of the tower is 10 feet tall and has an area of up to 90 square feet. Access between the different floors and levels can consist of a simple ladder and hatch, a stairwell, or small teleportation circles that lead to the room of your choice. Each level takes one of the following forms, chosen by you when you cast the spell:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A master bedroom with a bed, chairs, chest, personal bathtub and wash station, and magical fireplace that never goes out.</li>
                <li>A study with desks, books, bookshelves, parchments, ink, ink pens, quills, and other academic instruments.</li>
                <li>A dining space with a table, chairs, magical fireplace, containers, and cooking utensils.</li>
                <li>A kitchen space with an oven, table, stools, cooking utensils, and raw ingredients, such as spices, herbs, vegetables, fruit, and grains that replenish upon the next casting of this spell.</li>
                <li>A lounge with couches, armchairs, side tables and footstools.</li>
                <li>A washroom with toilets, wash tubs, a magical brazier, and sauna benches.</li>
                <li>An observatory with a telescope, maps of the night sky, and other astronomical instruments.</li>
                <li>An indoor garden, filled with common ingredients and plants, a table with an alchemy set and Alchemist’s Supplies, a small fountain or stream, small glowing crystals throughout the garden, and several small woodland beasts or insects that live in the garden. A bedroom filled with up to six beds and chests, a wardrobe, and a fire place.</li>
                <li>A storage cellar filled with wine racks of simple wines, crates, barrels, and plain chests.</li>
                <li>An open roof with a small table, chairs, and a brazier or large crystal that constantly emits a warm light within a 20-foot radius from the center of the roof.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">The layout of the rooms can take any order that you wish, however the rooftop always remains the highest. The interior of the tower is warm and dry, regardless of conditions outside. Any equipment or furnishings conjured with the tower dissipate into smoke if removed from it. At the end of the spell’s duration, all creatures and objects within the tower that were not created by the spell appear safely outside on the ground, and all traces of the tower and its furnishings disappear. Any equipment or objects that were taken into the tower can be left safely within the tower’s rooms, and remain in the place they were left until the next casting of this spell. Objects left within the tower that were not conjured within the tower as part of the casting of this spell can be safely taken out of the tower.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you first cast this spell, you and creatures of your choice can enter the tower and a 20-foot-radius area outside of the tower. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. By means of this spell, the tower can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell, you can choose to have the tower become invisible to creature you do not allow inside, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by the divination of spells. You always know the exact location of the tower, and you can never be barred from entering your own tower.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can set a condition for a creature to find and locate the tower. The condition can be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target. Examples include a specific password or phrase that must be said. You can change the password needed to see and enter the tower by spending 10 minutes in meditation within the tower.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you are within the tower, if you cast the unseen servant, tiny servant, or animate objects spell, you can choose to have the beige you create become permanent, so long as they remain within the tower. You can have only one of these spells remain permanent within the tower at a time, and they appear along with the tower when you cast this spell to summon the tower again. Each servant you create can move freely within the tower and the 20-foot radius surrounding the tower. For the unseen servant spell, you can choose to have it become seen and take a form of your choice. It’s Intelligence becomes 10, and it can speak, read, and write each language that you know. It gains a simple personality, such as cheerful, gloomy, lethargic, energetic, or playful.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can cast this spell again while it is active to maintain the tower’s existence for another 24 hours. You can create a permanent tower by casting this spell in the same location and with the same configuration every day for one year. When the tower becomes permanent, you can choose to keep the tower under the effects of being hidden away permanently, or can choose to have this feature become activated on your command.</p>

            <p>You cause the air around a creature that you can see within range to pulse and vibrate rapidly before watching them quickly shrink down to the microscopic level, causing them to enter into a subatomic realm. The target remains there for the duration or until it can escape.</p>
            <p class="indent">While in the subatomic realm, the creature sees atoms and other microscopic matter float by them. A creature in this state is immune to all attacks and spells, and attempts made to locate them via divination spells fail.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target can use its action to attempt to break free of the spell and escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Constitution check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends. If the creature fails, it takes 8d8 force damage, as it is bludgeoned by atomic matter.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>

A creature takes 12d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            <p>Your eyes briefly flash with bright red light before cold, black flames silently wreath around one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. It takes 6d8 fire damage and 6d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target is cursed and also burns for the spell’s duration. The curse causes the burning target‘s speed to be reduced to 0, and the creature must spend its each of its subsequent turns writhing in pain. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 2d8 fire damage and 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can’t be extinguished through both magical and nonmagical means. A remove curse spell cast with a spell slot of 7th level or higher ends this effect.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The creature forgets its own name, if it had one.</li>
                <li>The creature forgets all personal memories, but retains all of its common knowledge, such as how to walk, eat, and speak Common.</li>
                <li>The creature fails to recognize that it has any class features, special abilities, skill proficiencies, or any magical equipment attuned to it, and thus will not make any use of these features unless it relearns how to use them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">For 24 hours after this spell has been cast, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks, and all Charisma based skill checks made against it are made at advantage. After this time, the creature is free to make decisions and actions, as well as filling in the gaps in its mind, on its own based on the information presented to them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Examples of ways in which a creature can be while under the effects of this spell might be that the creature swaps to an opposing side in a war, proceeds to follow and serve another creature, or begin to believe that their life has a new purpose. If the creature had any class features or special abilities, the creature can learn to use them again if taught how to do so.</p>
            <p class="indent">A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target using a 9th level spell slot restores the creature’s lost memories.</p>

		<supports>Sorcerer, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You summon forth pulsating atomic energy in an 80-foot cube within range. Each target within the affected area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 40d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its atomic structure collapses and it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, even magic items of rarity Rare or lower, are obliterated and nothing remains of them. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell automatically obliterates a nonmagical object or creation of magical force within the affected area. If a target is only partially occupying the affected area, only the section of the target within the area of the spell is affected by the spell’s effects. A magic item of rarity Very Rare or higher is unaffected by this spell, but loses its magical properties for 1d6 days.</p>
            <p class="indent">The physical stress of casting this spell weakens you. After you finish casting this spell, you must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you gain two levels of exhaustion, or only one level of exhaustion on a successful one. This exhaustion can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. The exhaustion lasts for 2d6 days.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You summon forth a mighty series of six mighty plagues, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Dark green and black clouds fill the air, foul smells of decay and disease sail in the wind, and a low droning sound can be heard omnipresently. Each creature under the clouds (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the clouds) when they appear must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned for 5 minutes. This is considered the first plague, the Plague of Black Poison.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, you conjure forth a different plague on your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 2-3, Second Plague: Plague of Dreaded Rats:</strong> Thousands of rats swarm the ground, climbing and tearing at anything in their path. Each creature and object in the rat swarm’s path take 1d6 piercing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 4-5, Third Plague: Plague of Stone Toads:</strong> Toads and frogs rain down from the clouds. Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 6-7, Fourth Plague: Plague of Green Lightning:</strong> You summon forth six bolts of green lightning from the grounds to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the clouds. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 4d6 lightning damage and 4d6 acid damage on failed save, and half as much on a success. A creature who fails their saving throw takes 1d6 acid damage at the start of their next turn for the remainder of the spell’s duration.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 8-9, Fifth Plague: Plague of Blackened Veins:</strong> Boils and blackened vein-like marks begin to appear on exposed flesh of creatures under the clouds. A creature under the clouds must make a Constitution saving throw against this disease. The creature takes 1d6 acid damage and 1d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success. A creature who fails their saving throw has disadvantage on Charisma checks for the remainder of the spell’s duration.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 10, Sixth Plague: Plague of Bloody Locusts:</strong> Hundreds of thousands of blood covered locusts swarm in the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature takes 4d6 piercing damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. This swarm of bloody locusts count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, the swarms of locusts eat into any exposed crops, wood, cloth, or fabrics in the area.</p>

            <p>Mixing the material components into a bowl, you set them on fire while uttering a string of arcane words as you attempt to bind a creature to a location so that it is cursed to never leave. While the material compnents are burning, choose a target as well as a location. The target must be within range, though the location does not have to, provided that you have been to that location before and can form a clear picture of it in your mind. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed, permanently bound to the location of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the target is cursed and bound to the location, the target can act and move around freely within an area of your choice between either a minimum of a 10-foot radius and a maximum of a 200-foot radius of the point the creature is target is bound to, the range of this radius being chosen at the casting of this spell. If the target attempts to move further than the set radius, the target is immediately pulled back by magic until within the bound radius.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, the target is unable to perform spells or other abilities or be affected by spell or other abilities that would enable the target to teleport or use any other means of extraplanar or planar travel.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure forth a gate barricaded with chains, locks, and arcane seals. The gate either emerges from the ground, appears in a flash of light, or appears to emerge from a wall. The gate can appear as you wish, either as made of ornate wood, appearing as a prison cell door, or as a wrought iron gate, however the gate is 20 feet wide, 40 feet tall, and 5 feet deep, and appears dark within the gate should you look through it.</p>
            <p class="indent">By turning the key into the padlock, you unbind the chains, locks, and arcane seals covering the front of the gate, and a deep rumbling sound is heard from within the gate itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">You summon forth a creature of challenge rating 10 that emerges from the gate, which then disappears in a similar fashion as to how it was summoned. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends, at which point the gate re-emerges and draws the creature back within it before disappearing again.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature, regardless of its type, alignment, or intelligence, is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long as they don’t violate its alignment. If you don’t issue any commands to the creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">You have advantage on concentration checks to maintain this spell if either or both the key and padlock were made from or within a plane of existence where the summoned creature originates from, such as the Feywild or the Abyss. If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the creature, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and the creature regards all creatures that it can see as a threat. An uncontrolled creature can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it. The DM has the creature’s statistics.</p>

            <p>By means of this spell, you can bind a single creature into a prepared book, sustaining it in suspended animation and filling the book with its experience and knowledge that presents itself in a language of your choice. The tome’s weight varies, as the tome has one page for every day of the bound subject’s life. The cover and binding transform to reflect the subject’s appearance, interests, and tastes. Every thought and memory, including those the target may have forgotten long ago, are perfectly transcribed within the enchanted pages, penned in incredible detail in both the language that the creature was thinking or speaking in when the event occurred and a language of your choice. If a memory includes dialogue in a language the subject didn’t understand, that dialogue is written in the language it was spoken in. Any alterations to a subject’s memories, such as by a spell or other magical effect, are presented in their true nature as well as an annotated section describing in detail the nature of the alteration.</p>
            <p class="indent">Spells that modify or remove text have no effect on the contents of this book, save for effects granted by means of the wish spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature imprisoned by this spell automatically fails any saving throws against effects to change its memories or the text in the page.</p>
            <p class="indent">A target bound by this spell can be freed only by means of the miracle or wish spell, or by uttering a special phrase that you assign to the book. This phrase can be in any language, and must be under twenty five words long. This spell makes the imprisoning tome supernaturally durable (AC 28, 10 hp per HD the imprisoned creature had). Destroying the tome immediately slays the creature imprisoned within, and all memories the creature had are lost.</p>

            <p>You create an ethereal door on a flat solid surface that you can see within range. The door is large enough to allow Large creatures to pass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane. The demiplane can be up to a 1 mile diameter sphere, within which the appearance can be decided by the caster. You choose the weather, terrain, flora, fauna, and any kind of lodging and structures that occupies the demiplane. Creatures can live within the demiplane, provided they have the food and supplies to do so.</p>
            <p class="indent">Crops and other flora can grow like normal, and the caster can choose to allow seasons to change, or to have only one season. While you can create only simple animals and plants when you first cast this spell. However, you can plant crops and other flora from outside of this demiplane within it, and it can grow. You can also bring in outside fauna and other creatures to reside within this plane as well.</p>
            <p class="indent">By means of this spell, this demiplane can be hidden away, safe from detection for the duration. The demiplane can’t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by the divination of spells. Additionally, you, and any creature of your choice can learn the password to get into the demiplane.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also disappears from the other side.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature, as well as the password set by the casting of this spell by another creature, you can have the ethereal door connect to its demiplane instead.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell can only be dispelled by the caster, or by means of the wish spell.</p>

Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners.

            <p>Considered to be one of the most taboo spells ever created, this spell grants longevity, youth, and power to those who use it. By having the body of a mortal humanoid creature who is unconscious as a sacrifice, you attempt to draw their life force and soul into yourself. While performing this ritual, you carve a small circular ring into your flesh, chanting a vile arcane phrase. Until this spell is complete, you are unable to cast any other spell, and cannot be affected by any other spell, or this spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">After 1 hour, if the sacrifice has not woken up, it’s soul leaves it’s body and is absorbed into your own. The creature’s soul cannot be retrieved by any means save for the wish spell, and you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <p class="indent">Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24, and you have advantage on Constitution saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent">You cannot be aged magically, and your lifespan is increased by 100 years. You also appear youthful and beautiful.</p>
            <p class="indent">For every soul you absorb, your lifespan increases by an additional 100 years. When a soul is retrieved by means of the wish spell, you automatically lose all benefits granted by this spell, and your lifespan decreases by 100 years for every soul retrieved. If all souls absorbed by you are retrieved, you immediately die, crumbling into dust and ash, and your soul is destroyed.</p>
