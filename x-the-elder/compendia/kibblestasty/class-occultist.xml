        <supports>Bard, KT Occultist, Sorcerer, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You bring a small or smaller object to life. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. The object has the following stats: HP: 20, AC: 18, Str: 4, Dex: 18. If the object is a weapon, it has an attack modifier equal spell attack modifier to hit, and deals damage equal to weapon’s damage die + your spell casting modifier. Otherwise, it has an attack modifier equal to your spell casting modifier and deals 1d4 + your spell casting modifier damage on hit.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the object is a weapon, you can command it to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Targeting a creature you can see within range, you bring it’s shadow to life under your control. If the creature has a CR of more than 3 or the creature has no shadow (either from the nature of the creature or from the lack of a light source to cast one) the spell fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">Otherwise a copy of the creature is created using its game statistics is created adjacent to the creature (on the side away from the brightest light near it). The shadow has no legendary actions, legendary resistance, and cannot cast spells. The shadow creature has hit points equal to half the target’s hit point, and looks like mirrored version of the creature it was summoned from formed from inky black smoke. The creature is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources while in darkness. The creature is vulnerable to all damage while in bright light, and always vulnerable to fire, lightning, and radiant damage. If the shadow is killed, the target creature it was summoned from casts no shadows for the next 8 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">The shadow acts immediately after the creature’s turn, and without further direction it attempts to follow and takes the attack action against it was summoned from. As a reaction to the shadow starting it’s turn, the caster can exert control over it and cause it to move and take its action as the caster directs.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the maximum CR of the target increases to CR 4. When you cast it using a 7th- or 8th-level spell slot, the maximum CR of the target increases to CR 5. When you cast it using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, the maximum CR of the target increases to CR 6.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You touch a hut, cabin, or other building no more than 20 feet by 20 feet by 20 feet. On completion of the spell, the building grows legs large enough to support it, as well as the structural integrity needed stand and move, and becomes a gargantuan creature. It has 450 hit points, an AC of 14, and a walking speed of 20 feet. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">On your turn, you can direct it to move (no action required) and it will continue to move as directed until you direct it to stop or reaches its destination. It can take no actions, but if it walks over a large or smaller creature, you can direct it to attempt to step on that creature, and that creature must succeed a Dexterity saving throw, or take 4d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.</p>

            <p>You cast a curse targeting two individuals. Both targets must make a Charisma saving throw (which they can choose to fail). If both targets fail their saving throws, for the duration of the spell their souls swapped. A soul controls the body it inhabits. It gains any ability score or action the body had (besides legendary actions or legendary resistance), but retains it’s own spell casting (if it has the spellcasting, innate or otherwise), and has disadvantage on all attack rolls and strength, dexterity, and constitution saving throws for 1d4 turns after swapping bodies.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a swapped creatures turn, it can choose to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature dies while while it’s soul is swapped, the souls return to their original bodies. If a soul was in a dying creature that returns to a living body, that creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage.</p>

            <p>You target a point and call forth tendrils twisted vines and gnarled roots of dark eneregy to erupt from the ground in a 60 foot radius. All creatures of your choice must make a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained as the shadowy plant tendrils grasp and drain the life from them.</p>
            <p class="indent">At start of a creature’s turn, if it is restrained by the spell, it takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage, and 2d10 necrotic damage. Each time a creature takes necrotic damage from this spell, the caster regains 1d4 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature restrained by the tendrils can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A tendril can be destroyed freeing a creature by dealing 20 damage to it, but they are immune to all damage besides radiant and fire.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures that end their turn within the radius while not restrained must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by the tendrils.</p>

            <p>Dark energy tears the moisture from a body, sapping of life and vitality. The target must make a Constituion saving throw. The target takes 5d10 necrotic damage on a failed save and becomes withered until the start of your next turn, or half as much on a successful one and does not become withered. A withered creature gains vulnerability to fire damage if they are not resistance to fire damage, or loses their resistance to fire if they were resistant to fire.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

            <p>You reach out and grasp the imperceptible threads of fate, subtly manipulating them. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you can use your reaction to tweak their fate, altering the value of the roll. You can choose to manipulate fate after the die is rolled, but before the outcome is determined.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can alter the roll of the die to an adjacent number to the number rolled (outcomes listed on the table below).</p>

            <p class="indent">When you alter a roll, you can choose to cast aside subtlty and yank the thread of fate, and select any value of the d20 as the outcome of the result, but the backlash causes you to take 1d6 necrotic damage * the difference in the value selected from the value rolled, and the spell immediately ends after the result is changed.</p>
