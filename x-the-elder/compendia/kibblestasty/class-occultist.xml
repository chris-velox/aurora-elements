        <description>
            <p>Wisps of purple smoke and dancing shadows rise from the ritual as the young human woman with strange magical markings tattooed across her hands whispers words in a language long forgotten, calling forth ancient powers.</p>
            <p class="indent">The woods creak and bend, black wings beating as raven alights on the outstretch hand of an ancient elf, her eyes as black as the raven’s. Soft words are spoken, and the elf nods in agreement.</p>
            <p class="indent">A young orc lets out a bellowing roar and lames burst into a form taller than an gre causing her enemies to flee. She holds p her spear and the flames pour from the oaring fire spirit to it, swirling about it, ausing it to roar alight with searing agical flames.</p>
            <p class="indent">The mysterious halfling woman gives a knowing smile, her unseeing eyes focused on you. She knows what you’ve come for, and tosses a handful of incense into the fire; what it is she sees in there? Your fate? Your destiny? As she speaks, it is only in riddle.</p>
            <p class="indent">Occultists are those that follow the old ways, a path of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it. They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that few fully understand, even those that use them, but they know it will work, for it always has.</p>
            <h4>ANCIENT TRADITIONS</h4>
            <p>Occultists are spell casters following legacies that go far back. While they may or may not be directly tutored or influence by another member of their tradition, their path to magic involves unearthing ancient secrets, old ways, and knowledge gleaned from spirits, ghosts, and elementals.</p>
            <p class="indent">The often personify aspects of their magic in ways that other casters find odd, coaxing and manipulating magic forces by ancient laws and bargains. Occultists tread between the arcane and the divine, not necessarily worshiping any god, but treating gods and spirits alike with cautious respect for their domains, asking for the what they take, and carefully giving thought to their actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each tradition that appears in the Occultist is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story. Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their traditions, and they are often seen in this context. Though villagers and the superstitious might fear them and their magic, they may be more likely to turn to them than a Wizard, for at least an Occultist makes sense to them, even if they are scared by their powers.</p>
            <h4>SPIRITUAL MAGIC</h4>
            <p>A common thread of the magic wilded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the demi-divine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic oft through the intermediaries of the power of gods, spirits, elementals, and more. An Occultist is fundamentally tied into the greater magical world, being neither a source of magic nor an academic researcher of it, but wielding it through intuition, cunning, and tradition.</p>
            <p class="indent">Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects; the verbal component of an Occultist spell might be the spirit they call upon to work the effect they wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or words in a language that binds or persuades.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN OCCULTIST</h4>
            <p>When creating an Occultist, the most important decision will be what Tradition you follow. Each Tradition of an Occultist is distinct with divergent flavor and calling upon a different aspect of folklore. Do you embody the associations or defy them? What led you to this path? Did you uncover your tradition on your own or were you taught by another?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an Occultist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the poison spray and produce flame cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells burning hands, cause fear, cure wounds, and tasha’s hideous laughter.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>
                <p>As a practioner of occult magic, you have inherited and developed techniques to manipulate reality through mediums of rituals, spirits, elements, and more. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Occultist spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Occultist spell list. You learn additional Occultist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Occultist table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Occultist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Occultist spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>witchbolt</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>witchbolt</i> using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Occultist spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Occultist table shows when you learn more Occultist spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Occultist spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Occultist spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Occultist spells. Your magic comes from a practitioners knowledge of traditional, ritual, and the way things work learned through experience, care and cunning. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Occultist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast any Occultist spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an occult fetish as a spellcasting focus for your Occultist spells.</p>
                <div>
                    <h5 class="caption">OCCULT FETISH</h5>
                    <p>Similar to a Holy Symbol or an Arcane Focus, an Occult Fetish is a magical focus, but one that functions for the Occultist.</p>
                    <p class="indent">It can be almost anything, though usually has a somewhat macabre bent, such as a skull decorated with feathers or pendant decorated with teeth and runes.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can buy or make one for 10 gp, and it typically weighs about 1 lb.</p>

Any occultist spell you know of 3rd level or lower becomes a ritual spell for you.

                <p class="indent">Additionally, your mastery of rituals allows you to work them more quickly, and a spell only takes additional turns equal to the spells level to cast (for example, casting a 3rd level spell as a ritual would take fours turns to cast, casting as your action or bonus action on the fourth turn).

            <p>An oracle is an occultists whose power comes to them from their connection to fate; bound and empowered oracles carry some piece of divine mystery within them, tied to an aspect of destiny and fate. As their power grows they begin to understand this mystery with revelations, unlocking its secrets and the power they contain.</p>
            <p class="indent">An oracle typically does not directly serve a god, rather they often are people who’s fate has entangled them in the affairs of the gods. Oracles have great power, but their powers are not ones that mortals were meant to have, and consequently they are frequently burdened by their powers.</p>

                <p>Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action you can call a spirit to your side. This can be a primal spirit of fire, cold, or lightning, or an ancestral spirit with radiant or necrotic power. This bond lasts for 10 minutes once formed. You can release a spirit early as an action, and it is immediately released if you call another spirit.</p>
                <p class="indent">While a spirit is bonded to you it strengthens your melee weapon attacks, causing them to deal an additional 1d4 damage of the spirit’s type.</p>
                <p class="indent">As a bonus action while it is bonded, you can manifest the spirit within 30 feet of you. The spirit is medium sized but spectral in nature while manifested. While the spirit is manifested, whenever you take the attack action you may replace any number of attacks you could normally take with melee spell attacks from your bonded spirit. Melee spell attacks done by the spirit deal 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier damage of the same spirit’s type on a hit. As a bonus action you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction or recall it to yourself, ending its manifestation.</p>
                <p class="indent">A manifested spirit cannot move more than 60 feet from you, and is recalled to you if you move more than 60 feet from it.</p>

            <p>A Witch can be many things, and most often refers to someone that villagers find scary and weird, but at the heart of every crazed story there’s a sliver of truth, and that truth is that witches do indeed exist.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some may live openly as what they are, while others may be the last person the superstitious villagers might expect. Varied in their powers, designs, and traditions based on their Coven, generalizing about a Witch is challenging, but they are most often defined by the varied utilitarian magic, hexes that make crossing them unwise, and powerful intelligent familiars.</p>

                <p class="indent">Various lore and mythos in and out of a setting may make assumptions, but by their vary nature PCs tend to be the exception to rules, and this subclass is not limited to any particular gender.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You bring a small or smaller object to life. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. The object has the following stats: HP: 20, AC: 18, Str: 4, Dex: 18. If the object is a weapon, it has an attack modifier equal spell attack modifier to hit, and deals damage equal to weapon’s damage die + your spell casting modifier. Otherwise, it has an attack modifier equal to your spell casting modifier and deals 1d4 + your spell casting modifier damage on hit.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the object is a weapon, you can command it to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p>

            <p>Targeting a creature you can see within range, you bring it’s shadow to life under your control. If the creature has a CR of more than 3 or the creature has no shadow (either from the nature of the creature or from the lack of a light source to cast one) the spell fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">Otherwise a copy of the creature is created using its game statistics is created adjacent to the creature (on the side away from the brightest light near it). The shadow has no legendary actions, legendary resistance, and cannot cast spells. The shadow creature has hit points equal to half the target’s hit point, and looks like mirrored version of the creature it was summoned from formed from inky black smoke. The creature is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources while in darkness. The creature is vulnerable to all damage while in bright light, and always vulnerable to fire, lightning, and radiant damage. If the shadow is killed, the target creature it was summoned from casts no shadows for the next 8 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">The shadow acts immediately after the creature’s turn, and without further direction it attempts to follow and takes the attack action against it was summoned from. As a reaction to the shadow starting it’s turn, the caster can exert control over it and cause it to move and take its action as the caster directs.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot, the maximum CR of the target increases to CR 4. When you cast it using a 7th- or 8th-level spell slot, the maximum CR of the target increases to CR 5. When you cast it using a spell slot of 9th level or higher, the maximum CR of the target increases to CR 6.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You cast a curse targeting two individuals. Both targets must make a Charisma saving throw (which they can choose to fail). If both targets fail their saving throws, for the duration of the spell their souls swapped. A soul controls the body it inhabits. It gains any ability score or action the body had (besides legendary actions or legendary resistance), but retains it’s own spell casting (if it has the spellcasting, innate or otherwise), and has disadvantage on all attack rolls and strength, dexterity, and constitution saving throws for 1d4 turns after swapping bodies.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of a swapped creatures turn, it can choose to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature dies while while it’s soul is swapped, the souls return to their original bodies. If a soul was in a dying creature that returns to a living body, that creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage.</p>

            <p>You target a point and call forth tendrils twisted vines and gnarled roots of dark eneregy to erupt from the ground in a 60 foot radius. All creatures of your choice must make a Dexterity saving throw or be restrained as the shadowy plant tendrils grasp and drain the life from them.</p>
            <p class="indent">At start of a creature’s turn, if it is restrained by the spell, it takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage, and 2d10 necrotic damage. Each time a creature takes necrotic damage from this spell, the caster regains 1d4 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature restrained by the tendrils can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A tendril can be destroyed freeing a creature by dealing 20 damage to it, but they are immune to all damage besides radiant and fire.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures that end their turn within the radius while not restrained must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained by the tendrils.</p>

            <p>Dark energy tears the moisture from a body, sapping of life and vitality. The target must make a Constituion saving throw. The target takes 5d10 necrotic damage on a failed save and becomes withered until the start of your next turn, or half as much on a successful one and does not become withered. A withered creature gains vulnerability to fire damage if they are not resistance to fire damage, or loses their resistance to fire if they were resistant to fire.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

            <p>You reach out and grasp the imperceptible threads of fate, subtly manipulating them. Whenever a creature within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you can use your reaction to tweak their fate, altering the value of the roll. You can choose to manipulate fate after the die is rolled, but before the outcome is determined.</p>
