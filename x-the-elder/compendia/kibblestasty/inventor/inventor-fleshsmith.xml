            <p>A Fleshsmith is the sort of person that makes people uncomfortable. Even when encountered in the most ideal circumstances, they simply have the sort of gaze that makes one think they may be thinking "how could I improve that" as they look at you.</p>
            <p class="indent">A particular path of Inventor that has turned their creative talents... inward. They seek to understand and improve the limitations of flesh. All too frequently they place a slightly different value on aesthetic than others might, tending to find beauty primarily in efficiency.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Fleshsmith tends to be more eccentric than inclined to any particular alignment, though even the most benevolent one may find that the only reason their activities wouldn’t be illegal is that no one considered them possible.</p>
