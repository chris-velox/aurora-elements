            <p>A Gadgetsmith is an Inventor whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other Inventors may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a Gadgetsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.</p>
            <p class="indent">Quick footed and quicker witted, a Gadgetsmith is never caught without another trick up their sleeve. Their minds are always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever gadget.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but usually exemplifies a curiosity and distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment, leaning toward more Chaotic behaviors.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, you’ve mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Grappling Hook.</strong> As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or Smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it. Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it, however, this does not grapple it. Opportunity attacks generated by this movement have disadvantage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smoke Bomb.</strong> As an action, you can use this to cast <i>fog cloud</i> centered on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and does not require concentration. When you cast <i>fog cloud</i> in this way, you can set the radius at 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gadgetsmith Weapon.</strong> Pick one of <i>Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon or Shock Generator</i> from the upgrade section. You receive this upgrade and it does not count against your upgrade total.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5>UNLIMITED SMOKE BOMBS?</h5>
                    <p>If you or your DM is concerned about the unlimited use of Smoke Bombs, consider adding a Proficiency Modifier number of uses per short rest. This should not mechanically impact their usage, but the reason they do not have the limit is to encourage players to feel free to use them in non-combat situations. With limits, even ones that are not usually hit, players tend to treat their Smoke Bomb as exclusively a combat feature.</p>
