    <element name="Vicious Hound" type="Spell" source="source" id="ID_author_source_SPELL_VICIOUS_HOUND">
        <supports>Bard, KT Occultist, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You summon a particularly vicious looking illusory hound that ferociously chases a target within range. Only the target can see the hound that chases them. The target creature can attempt to flee from the hound, moving at least 30 feet in any direction from where they start their turn. If the target does not flee or is unable to move at least 30 feet from where they started by the end of their turn, they take 3d8 psychic damage from being mauled by the hound at the end of the turn. The spell ends early if the target gets more than 120 feet from you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of each of their turns, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw. On success, they realize the hound is an illusion, and the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the speed of the hound increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd (meaning that the target must flee 10 additional feet to avoid taking the damage).</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create and throw an illusionary dart at a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit, they take 1d8 psychic damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The number of darts you can throw with this spell increases when you reach 5th level (2 darts), 11th (3 darts), and 17th level (4 darts). You can direct the dart at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each dart.</p>

        <supports>Bard, KT Occultist, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You create a 5 foot radius illusory pit at a point you can see on the ground. Creatures within the radius must make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature fails their saving throw, believes they have fallen into the pit, and falls prone, cannot stand up, and is blinded beyond 5 feet of the illusory pit.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature can spend its action to attempt to climb out of the pit, repeating its Wisdom saving throw. On success, it spends all of its movement to stand up, and realizes the pit is an illusion, ending the spell for them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Flying creatures are unaffected.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast the spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the pit increases by 5 feet for each level above 1st, to a maximum of a 20 foot radius with a 4th level spell slot.</p>

        <supports>KT Occultist, Sorcerer, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an illusionary explosion of flame. Each creature of your choice within a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target takes 6d6 psychic damage on a failed save. A creature that passes their saves realizes the fire is illusionary and takes no damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can make the illusory effect an explosion of ice, lightning, or pure force energy.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">Targets of your choice</h5>
            <p>Unlike a fireball of actual fire, the illusionary version only hits targets of your choice, making it safe to use among allies, though it deals less damage and does no damage on a passed save (as the target realizes its illusory nature).</p>

        <description>
            <p>An illusory duplicate of every allied creature of your choice within 30 feet appears. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with the creature they are a duplicate of and mimic their actions, making it impossible to track which is real.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time a creature targets an affected creature with an attack during the spell's duration, roll a d20 to determine whether attack instead targets the duplicate. With a roll of 11 or higher, the duplicate is targeted.</p>
            <p class="indent">A duplicate AC equals 10 + the affected creature's Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all duplicates are destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature unaffected by this spell if it can't see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false as with truesight.</p>

        <supports>Bard, KT Occultist, Sorcerer, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You cause illusions of deadly traps or sudden hazards spring up filling a 60 foot cube originating from you. Blades swing on chains, spikes erupt from the ground, darts shoot unseen spots, lava spouting from the ground, vicious man eating plants, and other phantom hazards fill the mind of each creature of your choice within the area. An affected creature can move at half speed to evade the dangers, or move at their normal speed taking 1d8 psychic damage for each 5 feet they move within the area. Any affected creature that ends their turn in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 5d8 psychic damage, or half as much on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time a creature takes damage from ending their turn in the effect, they can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, they realize the traps are fake, and the area ceases to deal damage to them or impede their movement, as all the traps become faint transparent images. Creatures that are not chosen to be affected by the caster see traps as faint transparent images.</p>
