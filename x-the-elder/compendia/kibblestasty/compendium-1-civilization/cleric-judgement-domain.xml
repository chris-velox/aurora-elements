            <p>A Judgment Domain cleric is a cleric who oversees the distribution of law and order. The may do so in the name Justice itself, or in service to a particular face of justice, be that a lawful god - such as Tyr, Forseti, Helm, Torm, Ilmater... or even Bane, for those that dispense the Iron Fist of Tyranny the World might need - or at the behest of an institution of justice in the land.</p>
            <p class="indent">Employing a Justice Domain cleric is something that any ruling power must consider carefully. While they are almost always Lawful to the extreme, they answer only to their own, higher, ideals of justice.</p>
