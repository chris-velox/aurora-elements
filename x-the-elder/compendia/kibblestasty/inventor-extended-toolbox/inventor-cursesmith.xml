        <description>
            <p>A Cursesmith’s power is invariably marked by the dark decisions they’ve made; some ignore this lingering darkness, pursuing the heights of power their reckless creation allows. Others leverage the twisted side effects themselves, believing there are no mistakes, only opportunities. Darker still are those that truly embrace the darkness of their twisted creations, becoming twisted creations themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Cursesmith is not always evil, but they walk a path that dangles precariously over evil, making it an easy thing to fall into. They may be Lawful, but the laws they respect are rarely those of normal mortal society that might get in the way of their dark delving.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Inventors by seizing power that others dare not wield. You forge a melee weapon into a potent artifact. The weapon can be used as a weapon in its dormant state as a normal weapon, or stirred to life showing its true power as a bonus action. Select one of the following when you create the weapon as its awakened power:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Abhorrent Nature:</b> The weapon twists and writhes with unnatural life; you can select the Abhorrent Mutation Upgrade twice for free, and a third time at 11th level. Your weapon can benefit from multiple mutations.</li>
                    <li><b>Destructive Power:</b> The weapon hums with dangerous destructive power. Each time you deal damage with it, it deals additional damage equal to your Curse Die. The damage of the Curse Die is maximized when attacking objects or structures.</li>
                    <li><b>Necrotic Wounding:</b> The weapon inflicts necrotic rot on hit. This does not require concentration, but can only afflict one target at a time. The weapon deals necrotic damage while awakened.</li>
                    <li><b>Eldritch Eruption:</b> At the time of creation, select a evocation cantrip from the Wizard spell list with a spell attack roll. Attacks with this weapon can be replaced by spell attacks of that cantrip. Once per turn, you can add your Intelligence modifier to damage dealt.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent"><b>Curse:</b> You gain a Curse Die. Your Curse Die is a d4. At level 11, your cursed die becomes a d6. Regardless of the power selected, when you make an attack roll with the weapon using its awakened power, roll a curse die and subtract it from the result.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once awakened, the weapon can be surpressed back to it’s dormant state as a bonus action; if it has been awakened for a number of turns less than your proficiency modifier, you must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw to cause it to return to it’s dormant state.</p>

                <description>You can activate or surpress your weapon’s Awakened Power. While awakened, when you make an attack roll with the weapon using its awakened power, subtract 1d{{curse-die:die-type}} from the roll.</description>

                    <li>While attuned to this artifact, you can cast a 1st or 2nd level spell of your choice once per short rest without expended a spell slot (spell chosen when this upgrade is selected).</li>
                    <li>While attuned to this artifact, you can treat a 1 on a Death Saving throw as a 20.</li>
                    <li>While attuned to this artifact, one of your ability scores (chosen when this upgrade is selected) increases by 1, to a maximum of 24.</li>
                </ul>When you select this upgrade, you can a select the condition in which your weapon can be destroyed. Your weapon can no longer be permanently destroyed by any other means. This means can be absurd or implausible, but must be something potentially possible.

                <p class="indent">Each time after the first you use an action to manipulate the doll, after the effect takes place, the creature can repeat the Charisma with disadvantage, ending the effect on a successful save.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once a creature has been targeted by this spell, they cannot be targeted again for 24 hours.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When cast with a 5th level spell slot or above, the range of the spell becomes unlimited, as long as the target is on the same plane as the caster.</p>
