                <p class="flavor">Prerequisite: A missing arm to replace with this Thunder Cannon.</p>
                <p class="indent">One might hope to see this mostly on Warforged characters, but the world is a broad place. This weapon serves as a Thunder Cannon, but loses the two-handed property. The arm that this takes the place of cannot be used for anything besides holding and firing the thunder cannon or activating its upgrades.</p>
                <p class="indent flavor">Do you have an arm that can hurl a projectile so hard it deals Thunder Damage? Why not?</p>
