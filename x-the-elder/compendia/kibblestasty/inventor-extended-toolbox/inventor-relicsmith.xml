        <description>
            <p>A Relicsmith is a strange brand of Artificer, often viewed with spectism by their peers, they are bolstered by one simple fact: the inventions work. They harness holy power in ways that defines arcane logic, bringing a unique blend of methodology and faith. How their inventions work is a source of consternation to others, but in faith in their scriptures and inscriptions is rewarded... perhaps by the faith they have in them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Relicsmith’s are inheritors of ancient traditions, sometimes passed down to them, sometimes ones they have uncovered in their research... sometimes, perhaps, ones that they believe they have uncovered in their research. Patterns, connections, scriptures, and rituals, their tools are many and varied.</p>
            <p class="indent">Of course, those that walk this path tend to have strong conviction with extends beyond just their invention. A Relicsmith is as prone as any Paladin to have a driven and righteous (in their eyes) cause. Divine power in those restrained only by their own conviction can be a dangerous thing indeed.</p>
