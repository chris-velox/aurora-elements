        <description>
            <p>A Runesmith is an Inventor that has narrowed their focus to working a specific language of magic - powerful Runes that can channel long lasting power. These Runes come in many shapes and forms, the lore behind from many sources.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Runesmith can be a knight, his runes splashed with gleaming power across his armor, or a scholar lending their power to the companions, marking potent runes on their weapons before standing back, or even a strange tatooed mystic, their runes tattooed across their very body.</p>
            <p class="indent">Runesmiths are not inherently good or evil, though their rigorous attention to detail and patience tend to make them more inclined to a Lawful perspective.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 1st level, you can mark magical runes, imbuing the things they are marked onto with magic. A rune can be marked on a weapon, piece of armor, or directly onto yourself, as a type of runic tattoo. Each rune grants a passive ability based on what is marked on that enhances the ability of what it is marked on, and has an active ability that can be activated as an action or in place of an attack as part of the Attack action while it is marked.</p>
                <p class="indent">Only a single rune can be marked on a piece of armor or a weapon, though you can mark multiple runes on yourself. The affected creature of a rune is the creature wielding the weapon or armor it is marked on, or you if the rune is directly marked on you.</p>
                <p class="indent">When using a rune on yourself, you gain both the weapon effect (applied to your unarmed strikes and natural weapons) and the armor effect (as if you were wearing armor marked with that rune).</p>
                <p class="indent">You know the following runes, and can learn more from upgrades. You can mark your runes during a long rest, and can have two runes marked at a time, gaining the ability to have an additional rune marked at 3rd level (to three runes), 5th level (to four runes), and 14th level (to five runes). These last until you mark a new rune, with the oldest rune fading when you mark a new one after reaching your maximum number of runes. Upgrades that grant a new Runes does not increase this number, just expands the range of Runes you can mark.</p>
