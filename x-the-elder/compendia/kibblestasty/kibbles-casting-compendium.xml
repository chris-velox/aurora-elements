            <p>You cast your sense into the wind. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a blindsight of 60 feet, and you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. Your passive Perception gains +5, revealing any creature to you that is revealed by your elevated passive Perception.</p>
            <p class="indent">For the duration, when you make a ranged weapon attack, you do not require line of sight as long as it is in the range of your blindsight, and the target creature does not benefit from cover, as you can send your shots in twisting impossible lines riding the flow of the winds that only you can see.</p>
