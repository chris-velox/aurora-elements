        <description>
            <p>You unleash a beam of pure energy, selecting cold, fire, force, or lightning energy and blasting it outward in a line that is 60 feet long and 10 feet wide that persists at the start of your next turn. Any creature that starts their turn in this beam must make a Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take 8d8 damage of the beams energy type, taking half as much on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you are concentrating on this spell, your movement speed is zero. At the start of your next turn, you can use your action to maintain the beam or redirect it, rotating it up to 90 degrees. Any creature the beam passes through while rotating (if the beam passes completely through them and they will not start their turn inside of it) must make a Dexterity saving throw immediately, taking 4d8 damage of the beams energy type on a failed save, and taking no damage on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you do not use your action maintain or redirect it, the spell ends early.</p>

            <p>You focus your telepathic powers on a creature and ask it a question. It must make an Intelligence saving throw, or it conjures a short mental thought or image that answers your question to the best of its ability that you can perceive telepathically. If a character passes a saving throw against this ability, they have advantage on saving throws against it for next 24 hours.</p>

            <p>You you create an exact duplicate of yourself in an empty space you can see within 30 feet of you. When you cast this spell at the start of each of your turns for the duration, you can determine which of the duplicates is you.</p>
            <p class="indent">It has all of your stats, abilities, and equipment (including magic items). It acts on your initiative, and has its own actions, though it shares its concentration on this spell, and if either of you lose concentration, the spell ends. Your current hit points are divided between you and the duplicate (you can divide them however you want) and shares all other resources and abilities with you (including limited use magic items), with any usage by either you or the duplicate depleting the resource for both of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your duplicate can take any action you can take, but it can deal a maximum of 15 damage on its turn (any additional damage dealt deals no further damage, when dealing area of effect damage, damage is split between all targets equally up to the maximum).</p>
            <p class="indent">If either you or the duplicate is reduced to zero, the spell ends and you become the copy that was not reduced to zero hit points. When the spell ends, if both you and the duplicate are still present, decide which is you, and the other vanishes. Anything that was copied during the spell has the copied version vanish.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the starting hit points of you and the duplicate both increase by 15 (but neither you or the duplicate can be given more maximum hit points) and the maximum damage the duplicate can do during its turn increases by 10 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

            <p>You manipulate the nature of your body with magic temporarily giving it new properties. You can select three of the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your body becomes malleable and amorphous. You have advantage on saves and checks against grapples and the restrained condition, you do not suffer disadvantage from squeezing into smaller spaces, and you can squeeze through openings two sizes smaller than you.</li>
                <li>You grow one additional appendage. This appendage serves as an arm and a hand, though it can take the shape of an arm, tentacle, or similar appendage.</li>
                <li>You extend the length of your limbs, giving you a 10 foot reach on melee attacks, touch spells, and object interactions.</li>
                <li>Your flesh hardens, your base AC becomes 14 + your dexterity modifier if it is not already higher.</li>
                <li>You grow more resilient, adapting against one external threat. You gain advantage on one type of saving throw of your choice.</li>
                <li>You adapt your body to an aquatic environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</li>
                <li>Your body grows ablative armor. You gain temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting modifier at the start of each of your turns.</li>
                <li>You can grow one size larger or smaller.</li>
                <li>You sprout wings. You gain a flying speed of 30 feet.</li>
                <li>You grow a natural weapon; this weapon can have the statistics of any martial melee weapon and takes on a form vaguely reminiscent of it without the thrown property. You have proficiency with this weapon, and are considered holding it. You can use your spellcasting modifier in place of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls with this natural weapon. The natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">For the duration of the spell, you can use an action to change one or all of the properties, losing the benefits of your previously selected properties and gaining the benefits of the new selected properties.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher, you can select one additional property from the list of options, with one additional property per spell level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>Targeting a point you can see, you cause a cyclone made of whipping flames with a radius of 5 feet and height of 30 feet to form.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature starts its turn inside the cyclone’s radius or enters it for the first time during a turn, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed saving throw, it takes 3d6 fire damage and, if it is entirely inside the cyclone’s area, it’s also flung 15 feet upwards and lands 15 feet in a randomly determined horizontal direction. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not flung. When a creature is not entirely inside the cyclone’s radius but within 30 feet of its center at the start of its turn, it still feels the intense draw of the raging cyclone, and must spend 2 feet (or 3 feet if it is flying) of movement for every 1 foot it moves away from the cyclone.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature starts its turn outside of the cyclone’s radius but within 10 feet of its center, it must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet toward the center of it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the height of the cyclone as well as the distance a creature is thrown upward increases by 5 feet for each level above 3rd.</p>

            <p class="indent">Creatures in that line must make a Dexterity save. On a failure, a creature falls into a suddenly opened crevice in the ground, falling into it before it snaps shut, crushing them. From the fall and crush, creatures that fail the saving throw take 6d10 bludgeoning damage. The creature is buried in 10 feet of rubble, and creatures without a burrowing speed require 30 feet of movement to extract themselves from the loose rubble to return to where they failed the saving throw. If they end their turn while buried, they take an additional 1d10 bludgeoning damage.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You project an ethereal creation from your mind taking the shape of a medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack; so long as it does not move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack, on a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend Psi Points up to your per use limit to issue commands that effect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you cannot exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Strike (2 psi point):</b> The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Relocate (1 psi point):</b> The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Solidify (1 psi point):</b> You construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is not in another creatures space. It has an armor class of 16, and hit points of your Intelligence modifier + your Psion level. The construct etheral again if it drops to zero hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Grab (1 psi point):</b> Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct must make a Strength saving throw or be restrained. At the end of the creatures turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends of the construct becomes ethereal again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Grow (1 psi points):</b> Your construct by a size, and its damage increased by one die. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn unless you use Sustain. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8).</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Replicate (3 psi points):</b> You use Relocate, but the original does not disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another constructs and control both with the same action (commands only effect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Sustain (1+ psi point):</b> At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command an additional round. This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining solidify refreshes the constructs hit points to its maximum.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b>Aura of (3 psi points):</b> Instead of targeting a creature, it becomes an effect around you with a radius of 20 feet; any creature of your choice that enters or starts its turn in the area of effect is targeted by the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Existential (1+ psi points):</b> You can deal an additional 1d4 initial and bonus (if applicable) force damage to the target creature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Firm (2 psi points):</b> The target creature has disadvantage on the saving throw against the ability.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Lingering (1+ psi points):</b> You can apply the effect of Disruptive Touch to an affected creature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Supernatural (1+ psi points):</b> A supernatural effect of or on the creature is ended; if the effect is a magical or psionic power, it is only ended if the psi points spent on this modifier equals or exceeds the spell level or psi points spent on the effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the property is an innate property of a creature (either of the target creature, or effecting the target this power), it is only ended if the psi points exceed the CR (or class levels) of the target creature, and they return at the end of that creatures next turn. The supernatural effect cannot be its existence, unless it has less than 10 hit points and it would otherwise qualify.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">WHAT IS A SUPERNATURAL EFFECT?</h5>
                <p>Outside of spells or psionic powers, what a supernatural effect is will be up to your DM. I would typically consider things like a Beholder’s ability to float, a banshee’s screech, a medusa’s gaze, or similar effects to be an innate supernatural property that could be temporarily suppressed when the criteria was met.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You assault the mind of a target you can see within range, rending and devouring its psionic energy. The target must succeed a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the target is frightened or charmed by you, the psychic damage becomes 1d10 instead. Your consumption of this energy grants you temporarily boosted psionic power. The next time you deal damage with a psionic power before the end of your next turn, you deal an additional 1d6 damage on that power.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can target the corpse of a recently perished creature with this power, as long as the target has died within the last minute and not been previously leached by this power.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Rending (1+ psi points):</b> The target takes +1d6 psychic damage for each additional point spent. If the target is frightened of you or charmed by you, this adds +1d10 psychic damage per point spent instead.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Shredding (1 psi point):</b> You leave the targets mind and soul shredded, reducing their next Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throw before the end of your next turn by 1d4.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Nourishing (1 psi points):</b> On a failed saving throw, you gain 1d6 temporary hit points. If you are below half of your maximum hit points, you can choose to regain 1d6 hit points instead of gaining temporary hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Devouring (2 psi points):</b> The range of Mind Leech becomes a radius of 5 feet, centered on you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Stunning (3 psi points):</b> On a failed saving throw, the target becomes stunned until the start of your next turn. If the power effects multiple targets, select one target for this effect</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Thieving (1 psi point):</b> On a failed saving throw, you can draw from the target’s mind a spell it can cast (from a Spellcasting or Psionics feature). You must be aware that it can cast that spell; the target retains the ability to cast the spell, but you gain the ability to cast the spell using your Psionics feature by spending psi points equal to the level of the spell (restricted by your psi point limit). You can know one spell in this manner at a time, and retain the ability to cast the spell for 1 minute or until cast. If the spell is one that restores hit points, you reduce your own hit points by the amount healed by the spell.</p>
