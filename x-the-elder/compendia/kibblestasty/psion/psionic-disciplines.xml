            <p>Psychokinetics is the mental art of spontaneously creating and controlling energy; sapping energy to freeze or spontaneously creating it create bursts of fire or arcs of lightning. Dangerous and destructive, it provides devestating power.</p>
            <h5>ENERGY MANIPULATION</h5>
            <p>When you gain this feature, you can manipulate energy in minor ways at will. As an action you can cause a light that casts 30 feet of bright light and 30 feet of dim light, cause things you touch to catch fire as if touched by a match, cause small arcs of electricity, freeze or thaw up to 5-foot cube of water. Any ongoing effect you create lasts 1 minute. You can have up your Intelligence modifier simultaneous effects, after which another ends the oldest ongoing effect.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Precognition is the ability to see what lies ahead, piercing the veil of the future. Seeing things that most people cannot a Psion with Precognitive abilites can, to a limited extent, know the future; such a future is known by tracing it’s roots from the present, and grows more mysterious and cloudy as such roots grow distance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Such a future can be changed by the actions of the present, particularly by knowledge of said future and action to prevent or change it. This is the function most often leveraged by Precognitive Psions, peering into the future to steer around courses they seek to prevent or steer toward a possible outcome they seek.</p>
            <h5>PRESCIENCE</h5>
            <p>Your eyes wander to events before they happen. You can add your proficiency to Perception and initiative rolls; if you already are able to add your proficiency to Perception, you can add twice your proficiency.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you concentrate on your keeping an eye on the future (as if concentrating on a spell), you can use your Intelligence modifier when making Perception (instead of Wisdom) or Initiative (instead of Dexterity) ability checks, and make Intelligence saving throws in place of Dexterity saving throws.</p>

            <p>Nullification is the ability to interfere with the supernatural effects of the world, reverting reality back it’s original state.</p>

            <p>When you gain this feature, you can control the aura of interference, wreathing yourself in the disruptive power that asserts reality. You can end minor magical or psionic effects (such as the result of cantrips or zero point psionic powers) by touching them, and have resistance to illusions or magical damage from things you touch (gaining advantage on the saving throw against them, if applicable).</p>

            <p>Psychokinetics is the mental art of spontaneously creating and controlling energy; sapping energy to freeze or spontaneously creating it create bursts of fire or arcs of lightning. Dangerous and destructive, it provides devestating power.</p>
            <h5>ENERGY MANIPULATION</h5>
            <p>When you gain this feature, you can manipulate energy in minor ways at will. As an action you can cause a light that casts 30 feet of bright light and 30 feet of dim light, cause things you touch to catch fire as if touched by a match, cause small arcs of electricity, freeze or thaw up to 5-foot cube of water. Any ongoing effect you create lasts 1 minute. You can have up your Intelligence modifier simultaneous effects, after which another ends the oldest ongoing effect.</p>

            <p>Precognition is the ability to see what lies ahead, piercing the veil of the future. Seeing things that most people cannot a Psion with Precognitive abilites can, to a limited extent, know the future; such a future is known by tracing it’s roots from the present, and grows more mysterious and cloudy as such roots grow distance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Such a future can be changed by the actions of the present, particularly by knowledge of said future and action to prevent or change it. This is the function most often leveraged by Precognitive Psions, peering into the future to steer around courses they seek to prevent or steer toward a possible outcome they seek.</p>
            <h5>PRESCIENCE</h5>
            <p>Your eyes wander to events before they happen. You can add your proficiency to Perception and initiative rolls; if you already are able to add your proficiency to Perception, you can add twice your proficiency.</p>
