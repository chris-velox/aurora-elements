            <p>Most rogues can hide, but few hide in plain sight. From mere disguises to physical changes in color, Chameleons master covert skills both mundane and magical to immerse themselves into any situation and strike at a moment’s notice.</p>

            <p>Most infiltrators operate in cramped conditions far away from pursuers, but you can hide in the open. At 3rd level, when you hide, you and everything you are wearing or carrying change color to match a large or larger object to which you are adjacent, and you are considered invisible until you move more than 5 feet or take actions. Smaller objects provide insufficient cover to use this ability. You can hide using this feature even if other creatures can see you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 13th level, you can move up to half your walking speed during your turn without revealing yourself.</p>

            <p>At 9th level, your eyes mimic the abilities of your reptile namesake. Lightly-obscured areas don’t impose disadvantage on your Perception checks, and you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded. You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet, and can make Perception checks to search for hidden objects and enemies as a bonus action. At 17th level, your advanced eyesight also pierces magical illusions, granting you truesight within a 30 ft. range.</p>
