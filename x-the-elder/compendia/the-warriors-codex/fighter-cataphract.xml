            <p>It is said the stirrup, after the chariot and the saddle, changed warfare forever, and bound horses to war for centuries to come. Also known as knights, hussars, lancers, or dragoons, the tradition of heavy cavalry persists as a powerful force of shock, awe, and raw damage against enemy forces with its mobility and devastating mounted charges.</p>

            <p>When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain several benefits that represent your enormous cavalry training.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It only takes 5 feet of movement for you to mount or dismount a mount.</li>
                <li>You can choose to have attacks that target your mount target you instead.</li>
                <li>If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.</li>
                <li>You gain proficiency in animal handling</li>

        <description>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, you can exploit the ultimate heavy cavalry mounted attack: the charge. If you move at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and hit them with a melee weapon attack, you deal an extra 2d6 damage and can force them to make a Strength saving throw. If they fail, your momentum carries them 5 ft. away from you in the same direction you moved. If this shove causes them to enter another creature’s space, that creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and both fall prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are riding a mount with trampling charge or a similar feature, Lancer’s Charge allows the mount to make an attack as a bonus action rather than it making an attack itself.</p>

            <p>At 7th level, you support your companions, humanoid and animal, on long and lonely marches. You and other creatures traveling with you have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion imposed by a forced march, and you and your mount alike no longer suffer movement penalties for wearing heavy armor.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, any creature you use as a mount gains temporary hit points equal to twice your fighter level whenever it rolls initiative. You cannot grant this temporary HP to humanoids.</p>

            <p>The psychological effect of a powerful cavalry charge cannot be overstated. Starting at 10th level, whenever you hit with Lancer’s Charge, the creatures you damage and all creatures of your choice within 10 feet of them must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds on this save by 5 or more is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">Furthermore, when you are elevated at least 5 feet above a creature (such as when you are mounted, or have high ground) the first weapon attack you make against it each turn has advantage.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 18th level, you become the ultimate mobile juggernaut. You gain the same temporary hit points your mount does from Companions on Campaign when you roll initiative, whether you are mounted or not. Additionally, you have advantage on every attack you make against a creature with Shock Tactics, instead of the first.</p>
