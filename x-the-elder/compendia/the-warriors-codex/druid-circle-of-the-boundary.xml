            <p>Nature never stops evolving. Members of this circle know they must do the same if they are to survive a world of fire and steel. They walk the line between nature and civilization and use the greatest weapons of both to preserve the fragile balance between the two.</p>

            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you forsake the druidic taboo against metal armor and gain proficiency in heavy armor and martial weapons. When you transform using Wild Shape any armor you wear becomes barding for your animal form, which gives the same Armor Class. Your Wild Shape allows you to become a beast with a CR as high as 1/4 your druid level, though must abide by the other limitations on the Wild Shape table. Finally, you gain proficiency in one tool of your choice and in one of Insight, Deception, or Persuasion.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level all things fall to your jurisdiction. You can use an action and expend a druid spell slot of first level or higher to create one of the effects below. If the effect requires a saving throw, it uses your druid spell save DC.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Breached Foundations.</b> For one hour you bring the forces of decay upon buildings and edifices. You target up to five 30-foot cubes of a structure, which destabilize and collapse, or become overgrown by vegetation.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Clear the Brush.</b> Nonmagical plants in a 60 ft. radius around you wither, die, and rot away over the course of 1 minute. You can dispel magically-grown plants, such as those created by entangle or spike growth, as an action.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Dulled Swords.</b> One creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, every time it deals damage its attacks take a cumulative −1 penalty to attack and damage roll. This penalty cannot exceed a value greater than your Wisdom modifier and lasts for 1 minute.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Claws of Iron.</b> For the next hour, your weapon attacks in humanoid and Wild Shape forms gain a +1 bonus to hit and damage, and are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming damage resistance.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Thin the Herd.</b> One creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, every successful weapon attack made against it deals a cumulative +1 damage. This bonus cannot exceed your Wisdom modifier, and lasts for 1 minute.</p>
