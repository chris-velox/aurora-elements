            <p>Through your weapons and your words, you incite fervor in others. Whether attraction or lust, rapture or enthusiasm, in battle you use a combination of grace, dance, and the subtleties of romantic magic to beguile and bewilder.</p>

            <p>When you enter this college at level 3, choose one of the following styles of combat concupiscence. When you reach 14th level, you gain the new feature from the same style that you chose before.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Cupid.</b> You gain proficiency in greatbows, longbows, and recurve bows. When you damage a creature with one of these weapons (or a shortbow) you can use a bonus action to expend a use of your bardic inspiration and force your target to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, they are charmed by one creature of your choice that they can see for 1 minute, or until that creature damages the target. While charmed in this way, they are also paralyzed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Pole Dancer.</b> You gain proficiency in glaives, guisarmes, halberds, lucernes, pikes, pollaxes, and spears. While you are wielding one of those weapons (or a shortspear or boar spear) and you grant bardic inspiration, the creature receiving it gains temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier + your bard level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Seven Veils.</b> You gain proficiency in scimitars. When wielding a scimitar in each hand, you can use an action to force a creature hostile to you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, they are charmed by you. You can then use a bonus action to make one attack with a scimitar, as though you were two-weapon fighting. You have advantage on attacks against creatures charmed by you, though the charm ends after you damage them. You can also use accessories on your person as spellcasting foci, such as ribbons, veils, scarves, and shawls.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of which feature you chose, you can use the weapons you gained proficiency in as a spellcasting focus, and can use your Charisma modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity on attack rolls (but not damage rolls) made with those weapons.</p>
