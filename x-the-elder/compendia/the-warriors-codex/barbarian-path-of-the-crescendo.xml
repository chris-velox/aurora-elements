            <p>Every one of your blows is a drumbeat punctuating the rhythm of battle. Starting at 3rd level, when you hit a hostile creature with a weapon attack while raging, your rage damage bonus increases by 1. This bonus cannot exceed your barbarian level, and lasts until you miss an attack or your rage ends. If an enemy hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack against them.</p>

            <p>Starting at 10th level, you can charge through obstacles and barrel over enemies. When you take the Dash action, opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage. If you move at least 15 feet in a straight line while dashing and encounter an object or structure in your path, you can deal 6d6 bludgeoning damage to it. If it is destroyed, you continue moving with no loss in speed.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, if you move at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and make a weapon attack, you can attempt to shove them prone as a bonus action before you make the attack. You count as one size larger than your actual size when making this shove. At 14th level, this increases to two sizes.</p>
