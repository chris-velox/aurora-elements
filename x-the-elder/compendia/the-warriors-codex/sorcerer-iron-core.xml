            <p>This bloodline originates from a subset of elemental earth refined by millenia of industry. Some have an ancestor who survived immersion in molten adamantine, and others lived for generations in mining towns surrounded by veins of ore. Regardless of source, each Iron Core harbors a kernel of magical metal which manifests their magic as metallic power.</p>
