            <p>Exotic weapons are unwieldy, niche, or revolutionary. Others make poor weapons without intensive, specialized training that even typical PCs lack. They may be less effective weapons than popularly conceived and require expertise to use. A character can gain proficiency in an exotic weapon using the training rules in <i>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</i> or the <i>Weapon Master</i> feat. Specific classes or class features may also grant proficiency in these weapons.</p>

        <description>
            <p>These flexible weapons wrap around shields and other personal defenses. They ignore the AC bonus granted by shields and parrying weapons or reactions.</p>

    <element name="Ensnaring" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_ENSNARING">
        <description>
            <p>These weapons feature chain, rope, hooks, or other parts that can aid in entanglement. When you hit with an ensnaring weapon, you can use your bonus action to attempt to shove the target prone, disarm them, or pull them 5 feet towards you, using your weapon attack modifier in place of Strength (Athletics).</p>

    <element name="Finisher" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_FINISHER">
        <description>
            <p>Finisher weapons are well-suited to executing enemies at your mercy. When you make an attack against a prone creature with a finisher weapon, you roll one additional damage die.</p>

    <element name="Gunpowder" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_GUNPOWDER">
        <description>
            <p>These weapons utilize volatile chemical powder as a propellant to fire projectiles or explode. They cannot be used underwater. When you make an attack, a gunpowder weapon flashes brightly, expels smoke, and creates a bang that can be heard within 300 feet. Each time you attack with a gunpowder weapon, you expend one pinch of powder as well as a piece of ammunition. It takes an action to reload a gunpowder weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Carrying too much powder is risky. Every time a creature wearing or carrying items with the Gunpowder property takes at least 20 fire damage, one of those items explodes and is destroyed. The blast deals 2d6 fire damage and 2d6 thunder damage to all creatures and objects within 20 ft.</p>

    <element name="Nonlethal" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_NONLETHAL">

            <p>The weapon is designed to incapacitate or is otherwise capable of delivering a hit that does not kill the target. When you reduce a creature to 0 HP with this weapon you can knock a target unconscious and leave them stable. All weapons may be used to deal nonlethal strikes, but deal 1+STR bludgeoning damage instead of their typical value.</p>
        </description>

    <element name="Parry" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_PARRY">
        <description>
            <p>This weapons can parry incoming attacks. When you are attacked by a melee weapon attack from a target you can see, you can use your reaction to attempt to parry it, adding half your proficiency bonus to your AC for that single attack. Parries must be declared before the result of the attack is known.</p>

    <element name="Prone Fighting" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_PRONE_FIGHTING">
        <description>
            <p>When you are prone and make a melee attack with this weapon, you do not suffer disadvantage for being prone.</p>
        </description>
    </element>
    <element name="Status" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_STATUS">
        <description>
            <p>Status weapons inflict extra effects on powerful hits. When you hit with an attack roll with a status weapon and exceed the target's AC by 5 or more, it will inflict an additional status effect based upon the type of damage dealt. A critical hit guarantees a status effect.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Slashing weapons</b> inflict gaping wounds and profuse bleeding, inflicting additional slashing damage equal to your proficiency bonus. Objects, Constructs, and Elementals are immune to this damage, as may other creatures that do not bleed at the discretion of your DM.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Bludgeoning weapons</b> hit with staggering blows that daze the target. Inflicting this status causes the target's next attack roll to be made with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Piercing weapons</b> reward precise or focused attacks, punching holes in defenses and leaving a target vulnerable. Inflicting piercing status grants advantage on the first weapon attack against the target before the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Improvised weapons may inflict status depending on their damage type and the discretion of your DM.</p>
        </description>

    <element name="Sundering" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_SUNDERING">
        <description>
            <p>The weapon features qualities that crush, pierce, break, or penetrate armor. When you attack a target wearing a breastplate, brigandine, cuirass, halfplate, splint, or full plate, you gain a +2 bonus to the attack roll. You also gain this bonus against creatures with thick shells or metallic hides, and other creatures at the discretion of your DM.</p>
        </description>
    </element>
    <element name="Sweeping" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_SWEEPING">
        <description>
            <p>These weapons strike in broad motions. When you reduce an enemy to 0 hit points with a sweeping weapon, target another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, apply any remaining damage to it. If that creature is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to kill an enemy.</p>
        </description>
    </element>
    <element name="Wind-up" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_WINDUP">
        <description>
            <p>You can prepare attacks with this weapon to make it even more effective. You can use an attack to wind up or set your weapon. On the next attack you make with the weapon, you add an additional weapon die and twice your Strength modifier to damage. A weapon can only add one such damage die in this way. If no attack is made by the end of the wielder’s next turn it is no longer wound up. The wielder can use an attack to keep the weapon wound up for a subsequent round. A weapon that is wound up can be used to make an opportunity attack when an enemy enters its range.</p>
        </description>
    </element>
    <element name="Winged" type="Weapon Property" source="The Warrior's Codex" id="ID_FUBR_TWC_WEAPON_PROPERTY_WINGED">
        <description>
            <p>These weapons have specially-shaped heads that halt the forward movement of their target toward the user and can be used to catch shields and weapons. After hitting a huge or smaller creature with this weapon, it is unable to move straight toward you and its movement speed is halved until you make an attack roll against another target or it leaves your reach. While holding a creature in this way, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove the target.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also replace one of your attacks with an attempt to disarm a target, using your weapon attack modifier in place of Strength (Athletics).</p>
