            <p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood, where anger for anger’s sake is king. As a berserker enters a rage they thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of their own health and well-being.</p>

            <p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make an additional melee weapon attack when you take the attack action on your turn. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.</p>
            <p class="indent">While frenzied, you ignore the effects of all levels of exhaustion.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use a bonus action to terrify an enemy. Choose one creature that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn more than 60 feet away from you. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it is immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>
