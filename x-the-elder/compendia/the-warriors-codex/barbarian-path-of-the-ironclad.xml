            <p>Titans of physical strength, they have mastered defensive combat by using civilization's greatest innovation: metal. They eschew leather and furs for heavy plate, and exchange their crude weapons for gigantic, finely-forged instruments of destruction. Those who follow the Path of the Ironclad are barbarians for a new industrial age.</p>

            <p>More than any other barbarian, your rage is tempered by a defensive nature. Yet your strength and ability to exploit weight are unparalleled. Starting at 3rd level you gain proficiency in heavy armor, and may use all barbarian class features while wearing it. You may wield a versatile or heavy weapon in one hand as though it were held in two, though you cannot use two-weapon fighting with them. To attack with a two-handed weapon while holding it in one hand, you must use Reckless Attack. You also deal an extra 1d4 damage the first time you hit with Reckless Attack on your turn. This bonus increases to 1d6 at 10th level.</p>

            <p>You are part of a long lineage of martial creation, a history of innovation spanning millenia. And you must do your part. At 6th level, you gain proficiency in smith's tools, and can produce armor and weapons twice as quickly, at half the typical cost of supplies.</p>

            <p>At 10th level, you can swing the heaviest weapons with a mighty heave that crushes enemies beneath them. The first time you hit a large or smaller creature with a heavy weapon after using Reckless Attack on your turn, that creature is smashed to the ground beneath your weapon and knocked prone. You can drop the weapon and leave that creature restrained under it. A restrained creature must use its action and succeed on a DC 15 Strength in order to remove the weapon from themselves and stand up. If you attack again with that weapon, they are no longer restrained but remain prone.</p>

            <p>Starting at 14th level, you have learned to let your armor's weight carry your forward, even through obstacles. While you are wearing heavy armor, effects that move you against your will move you half as far, and you can power through difficult terrain without suffering penalties against your movement speed. You also have advantage on checks made to shove opponents or move objects.</p>
