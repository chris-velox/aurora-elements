            <p>Some people train from youth to be fast. Others use magic to enhance their speed. And still others have an apparently supernatural edge. Operating on instinct and mundane skill, their eternal tailwind pushes them on. They are the Windblown, rogues favoring hit-and-run tactics with the wind at their back.</p>

            <p>When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you move much more quickly when fleeing enemies. Whenever you disengage using your Cunning Action, you may shove one creature within reach of you. If you haven't successfully inflicted Sneak Attack on that turn, you may make 1 melee weapon attack against that creature instead.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also use Dexterity, instead of Strength, on Athletics checks made to shove enemies.</p>

            <p>Starting at 9th level, the climate always favors you. As long as you aren't inside or underground, you have advantage on Survival checks made to navigate and your movement speed increases by 10 feet. You and creatures with you cannot be slowed by poor weather during travel, though other factors may still reduce your pace. You also ignore disadvantage inflicted by strong winds on Perception checks and attack rolls, and gain advantage in those conditions instead.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at 13th level, the wind shelters you against projectiles. When you are targeted by a ranged attack you can use your reaction to inflict disadvantage on it and any other ranged attacks made against you until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and must complete a long rest to do so again.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 17th level, tailwinds thrust you forward in a single, deadly strike. As an action, you sprint at impossible speed in a straight line to an unoccupied space 30 feet away. Roll damage as though you had landed Sneak Attack with a weapon you're holding. All enemies within your reach as you move in that line take 1/3 that amount.</p>
            <p class="indent">You also gain the ability to fly in limited bursts. You have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed on your turn; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.</p>
            <h5>DASHING AND MOVEMENT:</h5>
            <p>If you Dash, your speed increases during your turn. This speed includes the flight granted by Whirlwind Sprint. Thus, you can fly 80 feet before falling, because you only fall at the end of your turn, regardless of your current speed. If you dash as both an action and a bonus action, you can fly 120 feet.</p>
