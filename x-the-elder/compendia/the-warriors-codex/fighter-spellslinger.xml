        <description>
            <p>A spellslinger studies a unique form of ranged combat first created by high elf archer-mages, who weaved spells into their bowshots. The magical shots of these elite warriors guarded their borders against monsters and marauders who borrowed or imitated their skills to create their own spellslingers. Such techniques are no longer secret, but they are esoteric, and this particular marriage of magic and precision remains effective wherever it goes.</p>

            <h5 class="flavor">ELEMENTS AND EFFECTS</h5>
            <p class="flavor">Take a moment to describe how an Arcane Shot interacts with the damage type of energized attacks. For example, for a Phasing Shot energized with lightning, you can describe the shot as a bolt of lightning that streaks from your weapon through each enemy. If you want, think of a signature combination your character is particularly proud of. Be inventive, and play up the sudden, unexpected tricks your character might create.</p>

            <p>Also at 3rd level, you can unleash special magical effects from your energized attacks. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see "Arcane Shot Options" below).</p>
            <p class="indent">Once per turn when you hit with an energized attack, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that projectile. You decide to use the option when the projectile hits the creature, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. If the option does bonus damage, it deals the same damage type that you chose for that energized attack. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, and regain all uses at the end of a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>
            <p class="indent">If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Arcane Shot save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <p class="indent">If another one of your features requires a saving throw, it uses this DC as well.</p>
