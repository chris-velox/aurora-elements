            <h4>TACTICS</h4>
            <p>The tactics are presented in alphabetical order. Unless stated otherwise, any movement referenced by a tactic is the movement granted by your Tactical Maneuver feature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Advance/Retreat.</i></b> The targeted ally can move up to its speed, rather than only half its speed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Charge.</i></b> The targeted ally can attempt to shove one creature of your choice. This shove can be attempted at any point before, during, or after the move.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Cover That Flank.</i></b> Attacks against the targeted ally have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Cut Them Down.</i></b> The targeted ally has advantage on the next attack it makes against a creature of your choice that you can see before the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Defend Yourself.</i></b> The targeted ally gains temporary hit points equal to your fighter level + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) for 1 minute.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Press Onwards.</i></b> If the targeted ally is charmed or frightened, those conditions end on the creature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Subdue Them.</i></b> The targeted ally can attempt to grapple one creature of your choice. This grapple can be attempted at any point before, during, or after the move.</p>
