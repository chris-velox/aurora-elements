            <p>As a trickling stream is humble and subtle yet ever-moving, so are followers of the Way of the Current. Water flows in constant motion, and so does this meditative martial art, which slides from one stance to the next. Each movement is chosen with practiced deliberation, which allows its users to remain untouched and serene as the torrent of battle rages around them.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, when you take the Dodge action you regain your sense of inner peace, soothing your racing heart and frantic mind, which allows you to enter a controlled, combat-ready position until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature misses you with a melee attack while you are in your stance, you can use your reaction to make an unarmed strike against that creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, when a Large or smaller hostile creature moves at least 10 feet straight toward you and enters your reach, you can spend 1 ki point to knock it off-balance and exploit its momentum to move it another direction of your choice, sending it sprawling to any point within 10 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 11th level, you can target Huge creatures with this feature, and at 17th level you gain the ability to target Gargantuan creatures.</p>

            <p>Water moves as it wishes, and is difficult to capture. At 6th level, you can attempt to escape when grappled or restrained with a bonus action, rather than an action, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to escape being grappled or restrained. You are also treated as one size smaller for the purpose of squeezing into spaces too small for you.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, you deal doubled damage to structures and objects that are not being worn or carried. The trappings of civilization are no match for a mighty flood.</p>

            <p>Starting at 11th level, the flow of your blocks and parries makes you nigh-impossible to touch. When you enter Stance of the Stream, you can spend an additional 2 ki points and gain the ability to reduce the damage of both ranged and melee weapon attacks with Deflect Missiles until your stance ends. When you deflect an attack, it only uses your reaction if you attack with a caught missile. You can only catch a projectile if you have a free hand, but can deflect any number of attacks.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you reduce the damage of a melee weapon attack to 0, you can use a reaction to throw the attacker to any point within 15 feet of you.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 17th level, you can weight your spiritual core and become the epicenter of a great astral whirlpool that pulls energy toward you. When you are targeted by a harmful area of effect, such as cone of cold or a behir’s lightning breath, you can use your reaction to drain the destructive power into yourself. As a result, it affects no objects or creatures other than you.</p>
            <p class="indent">You suffer no damage or other effects, and store the magical power within your ki. The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack before the end of your next turn, the energy is unleashed, causing the attack to deal bonus damage equal to the amount of damage you would have received from the effect you absorbed. The damage type is the same as that of the absorbed effect. If you fail to hit a creature before the end of your next turn ,the rampant energy explodes inside you. You suffer all effects from the power you absorbed as if you failed the saving throw.</p>
