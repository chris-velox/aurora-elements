            <p>Professional killers, master trespassers, and talented socialites, Infiltrators combine a keen eye and quick reflexes with mastery of the blade, stealth, and carefully-chosen word. Glamorous assassins who must infiltrate all manner of societies, their tongues are just as sharp as their knives.</p>

            <p>Your blows are deadliest when your foes are at their weakest and don’t realize you were ever there. Starting at 3rd level, you have advantage on initiative rolls, and on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted in combat. Any attack that you land against a creature that is restrained, unconscious, surprised, or has not yet taken a turn is a critical hit.</p>

            <p>Starting at 9th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dexterity</li>
                <li>Intelligence</li>
                <li>Wisdom</li>
                <li>Charisma</li>
                <li>Class levels (if any)</li>
                <li>Hit Points</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At the DM’s discretion, you might also realize you know a piece of the creature’s history or one of its personality traits.</p>

            <p>At 13th level, you can create a false identity by spending three hours considering facets of your new persona such as mannerisms, speech patterns, and clothing. If you spend at least 1 hour observing these features in an existing humanoid you can instead mimic that person instead. The identity also includes letters of introduction, forged certifications, appropriate clothing, etc. This disguise is indiscernible to the casual observer, and you have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks to maintain it when questioned.</p>

            <p>At 17th level, it is impossible to tell through magical means whether you are lying, and checks made to discern the truth of your statements are made with disadvantage. Magic cannot compel you to tell the truth, and your mind cannot be read through any means. The first time you damage a creature that regards you with affection or considers you an ally, you have advantage on the attack and forgo damage dice. Instead, you roll the maximum possible amount of damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you damage a creature that is surprised, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature.</p>
