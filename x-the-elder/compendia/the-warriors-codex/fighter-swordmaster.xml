            <p>While fighters can use a variety of weapons, swordmasters specialize in blades. Impossibly precise while wielding straight swords, this archetype includes the Swordmasters of Hoeth, the myrmidons of Magvel and Elibe, and the elite doppelsöldner landsknechts of the 16th century. While lighter-armored than other greatswordsmen to better employ their agility, they compensate with great defensive skill.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use large swords with enormous skill. When you are wielding a longsword or greatsword in both hands and are not wearing heavy armor, your walking speed increases by 5 feet, and you can also use your sword to parry attacks.</p>
            <p class="indent">When an enemy outside your reach attacks you, you can use your reaction to parry the attack. Add your Strength modifier to your armor class against that attack. If the attack still hits, roll the damage dice of your weapon and reduce the damage you took by the amount you rolled. If you reduce the damage to 0, any other effects that might result from the attack landing (such as Drow poison requiring a Constitution saving throw) do not apply.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether or not the attack hit or missed, if you take no damage from the parried attack, you can also move 5 ft and, if a target is in reach, make 1 weapon attack.</p>

            <p>At 7th level, you can use meditation and practice to purify your body. During a short rest you perform a ritualized series of trained maneuvers and meditative rests to remove a single poison, disease, curse, level of exhaustion, or similar detriment from yourself. The first time you roll initiative after this short rest, you do so with advantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature once per long rest.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can charge so swiftly that you seem to have teleported. You can use all of your movement to appear directly next to a hostile creature within 60 feet and make two weapon attacks, then take the attack action as normal. You take no attacks of opportunity from this movement. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (a minimum of 1), and must complete a long rest before you do so again.</p>

            <p>At 15th level, your defensive skill has improved. You can take two reactions per round, so long as at least one of those reactions is used to deflect an attack. When you parry an attack from a reach weapon, you make your counterattack with advantage if the weapon you parried was a halberd, pike, or similar polearm. Finally, you can counterattack even if you did not reduce the damage you took to 0.</p>
