            <description>
                <p>When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you exceed a common archer or triggerman and enter the realm of entertainment. You learn two of the following Trickshots, and an additional one when you reach 10th and 15th level in this class. You can only use Trickshots with ranged attacks made with ranged or thrown weapons. You can only use one Trickshot per attack roll, and cannot use Trickshots on attack rolls already affected by or granted by another Trickshot.</p>
                <p><strong>Barrage.</strong> You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition or thrown weapons for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.</p>
                <p><strong>Double Up.</strong> You can expend two weapons or pieces of identical ammunition instead of one on an attack, which deals an additional damage die if it hits. The close and long ranges of this attack are halved.</p>
                <p><strong>Hairtrigger.</strong> When you have advantage on an attack roll against a target, you can forgo the advantage for that roll to make an additional attack against the same target as a bonus action.</p>
                <p><strong>Heavy Impact.</strong> When you hit a Huge or smaller creature with an attack you can push them 5 feet away from you.</p>
                <p><strong>Richochet.</strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack you can make a second attack against another creature within 30 feet of the original target, using the same piece of ammunition. The second attack’s damage is halved.</p>
