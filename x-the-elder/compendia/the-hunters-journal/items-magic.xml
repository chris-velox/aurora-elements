            <p>An animal mask is worn over the face, and bears the form of an animal’s visage.

Attuning to the mask curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the mask fails to end the curse. When you use the mask’s last charge or are reduced to 0 hit points while cursed, you polymorph into the beast that the mask bears the visage of.

You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.</p>

    <element name="Box of Traps" type="Magic Item" source="The Hunter’s Journal" id="ID_AEYANA_THJ_MAGIC_ITEM_BOX_OF_TRAPS">
        <description>
            <p>This 1 lb. wooden box measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 3 inches deep. You can use an action to place a trap from the box in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, designating any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the trap. When the trap is placed, it expands to cover a 20 foot by 20 foot area and becomes nearly invisible.</p>
            <p class="indent">A trap is triggered when a creature moves into or within the area for the first time on a turn. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the trap was set must make a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice the trap before entering the area. A trap is a Tiny invisible object in the center of the area with an AC of 15, 15 hit points. If the trap is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed. It is also destroyed after 8 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent">The box contains 1d6 – 1 traps of each kind. The box becomes a nonmagical wooden box after the last trap from the box is placed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hoist.</em></strong> When a creature triggers this trap, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be magically hoisted 10 feet into the air. While hoisted, the creature can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. This effect ends if the creature leaves the trap’s area.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mine.</em></strong> When a creature triggers this trap, it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or trigger a mine, forcing each creature within 10 feet of the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, which the triggering creature automatically fails. A target takes 3d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Poison Dart.</em></strong> When a creature triggers this trap, the trap makes a ranged weapon attack against it (+7 to hit). This attack is made at advantage if the creature is not aware of the trap. On a hit, the creature takes 1 piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Quicksand.</em></strong> When a creature triggers this trap, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw be dragged 5 feet down into the ground and buried. A creature buried by this trap is restrained. It can use its action to attempt to free itself with a successful DC 15 Strength check.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Shock.</em></strong> When a creature triggers this trap, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 lightning damage and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also stunned until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Swinging Blade.</em></strong> When a creature triggers this trap, the trap makes a melee weapon attack against it (+7 to hit). This attack is made at advantage if the creature is not aware of the trap. On a hit, the creature takes 2d12 slashing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>

            <p>This glove has 3 charges, and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear this glove, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge from the glove to conjure an ethereal falcon, perched on the glove.</p>
            <p class="indent">The falcon has the statistics of a blood hawk, except its attacks deals force damage instead of their normal type and have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, and it can carry up to 60 pounds. Additionally, when it hits a Medium or smaller creature with a melee attack, you can choose to have it grapple the creature (escape DC 15) instead of dealing damage to it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The falcon acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it shares your initiative but takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move on its turn, but the only action it can take is the Dodge action, unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help actions, or to use its action to pick up an object that isn’t being worn or carried.</p>
            <p class="indent">The falcon vanishes after 1 hour, if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if you use your bonus action to conjure another falcon or dismiss it, or if it is more than 600 feet away from you.</p>

        <description>
			<p>A <em>figurine of wondrous power</em> is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Brass Monkey (Rare).</em></strong> This brass monkey statuette becomes a Small monkey with the statistics of a baboon for up to 1 hour. It radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of intoxication. Each creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison or become intoxicated for 1 hour, or until the monkey reverts to figurine form. Creatures that are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. When it becomes intoxicated and at the start of each of its turns, an intoxicated creature must roll a d6 to determine its behavior for that turn. While it is intoxicated, the creature can’t take reactions.</p>

		<description>
            <p>You can use a bonus action to drop this magic spear at your feet and speak the command word, naming a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. When you do so, the spear hides itself underneath dirt, leaves, or soft terrain, lying in ambush for 1 minute or until it is picked up. If you drop the spear over stone or otherwise solid terrain, it does not become hidden. A creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check in order to notice the spear if it is hidden.</p>
            <p class="indent">The first time the target moves within 10 feet of the spear, the spear darts into the air to attack. The spear uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls, and makes the attack at advantage if the target hasn’t noticed it. On a hit, the target takes an additional 1d6 piercing damage, and its speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn. The spear doesn’t make this attack if the target used the Disengage action before moving.</p>
            <p class="indent">Other types of magic spear-like weapons of this kind exist, such as abandoned javelins, lances, pikes, or tridents, though spears are most common.</p>

            <p>This magic crossbow has an automatic loader which allows it to hold up to 6 crossbow bolts and ignore the loading property. Once you have used all of its bolts, it can’t be fired again until you reloaded it as an action or a bonus action on your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to toss this magic crossbow in the air and speak the command word. When you do so, you cause the crossbow to hover in place and attack one creature within its range. The crossbow uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls. While the crossbow hovers, you can use your bonus action to repeat the attack against a creature within the crossbow’s range.</p>
            <p class="indent">After the hovering crossbow runs out of crossbow bolts, it falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it.</p>

		<description>
            <p>When you pull back this bow without an arrow, its dark-wood limbs release droplets of crimson blood, which form into a crimson arrow. You take 1d6 necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced in any way. The crimson arrow lasts until the end of your turn, or until you release it or let down the bow. When you make an attack using this crimson arrow, you have advantage on the attack roll.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Binding Blood.</em></strong> You take an additional 1d6 necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced in any way. If the arrow hits a creature, its movement speed is reduced by 20 feet as bands of blood bind it. A creature can use its action to attempt a DC 17 Strength check, ending the effect on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Blinding Blood.</em></strong> You take an additional 3d6 necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced in any way. If the arrow hits a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Diseased Blood (1/Day).</em></strong> You take an additional 5d6 necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced in any way. If the arrow hits a creature, it becomes poisoned as if under the effect of the contagion spell (save DC 17). Once this arrow option is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

            <p>A gossiping arrow is a magic weapon designed to distract and deceive curious creatures.
