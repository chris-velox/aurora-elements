            <p>Long have the performing arts been a favorite pastime of nobles and peasants alike. Actors and thespians perform stories that while fictional, reveal great truths about life, death, and the struggles in between. The Muse, the ancient spirit of inspiration, moves the hearts of actors, great and small, to give their all while performing for others.</p>

            <p>Bards of the College of Fools use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a tavern to the nobles of a royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, fools ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the tale of a stable hand’s affair with a duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin’s innocence, a fool never lets social decorum get in the way of truth.</p>
            <p class="indent">Fools adventure to undermine the plans of the powerful and arrogant. Among bards, fools are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.</p>

They enjoy the after parties more than their performances, and it is rare that they turn down an invitation for a good time. From formal of banquets of royalty to the harvest celebrations of small farming towns, Revelry bards live for parties and hedonistic gatherings of all kinds.</p>

				<p>Gods of light—including Helm, Lathander, Pholtus, Branchala, the Silver Flame, Belenus, Apollo, and Re-Horakhty—promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun. Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.</p>

				<p>Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.</p>

In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p>

				<p>Gods of trickery—such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki—are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.</p>

				<p>War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri- Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p>

				<p>The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu</p>

				<p>Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time. particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.</p>

				<p>The Prophecy domain focuses on foretelling danger and preventing harmful outcomes. Clerics of this domain are also known as “oracles.” Oracles pay special attention to dreams, intuitive thoughts, and hallucinatory visions. They are widely believed to be capable of predicting the future, though their visions are often misinterpreted. They live by the phrase, “know thyself.”</p>
				<p class="indent">Oracles often carry special varieties of incense and holy water with them. The holy water may be boiled to produce vapors, which the oracle inhales in order to enter a trance-like state. During such a trance, the oracle thrashes and wails as they experience flashes of divine insight. They often employ scribes to write down their words, so that they may be recalled later.</p>

				<p>Originally developed in Wildemount by the Claret Orders, the Blood domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force within one’s own physical body. The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell. The Gods of Blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson. Almost any neutral or evil deity can claim some influence over the secrets of blood magic and this domain, while the gods who watch from more moral realms shun its use beyond extenuating circumstance.</p>

				<p>To some clerics, the message of scripture is more important than the force behind it. They take inspiration not just from their holy books but from works of fiction, passed-down tales, and the fey of Thelanis themselves. As a cleric of the Story domain, you do not say prayers but instead recite passages of inspiring stories from memory. Your collection of books and scrolls is as important to the divine spark you draw power from as any holy symbol you bear.</p>

				<p>Soul Gatherer clerics roam the Hells, gathering souls that are lost, bound or enslaved. Some do this out of altruism, seeking to assuage the tormented soul and liberate it, while others collect souls out of a lust for power or control, seeking to dominate their spirit captives. Untethered spirits are naturally attracted to the aura of a Soul Gatherer, gathering in their wake. Anyone viewing a Soul Gatherer that can also see into the ethereal can make out a swarm of the incorporeal creatures crowding the cleric like a school of ectoplasmic fish. Others are connected to the Soul Gatherer by the cleric’s possession of their bound object, such as a soul coin or other receptacle, able to manifest due to the Cleric’s unique abilities.</p>

				<p>It is common when sickness and disease strikes a village or township for people to cower away from it. They fear the touch of the illness, fear that it might affect them too. Clerics following the Plague Domain have no such fear. They live to study the morbid steps of deadly diseases, combating them when they know how to, or perhaps letting the infection run its course with little hindrance. For some Plague Clerics, the information gained from the painful decay of a subject is sweeter than the blessed administration of a divine cure.</p>

				<p>Heretics preach of a void at the center of the universe that dying gods created to devour the Weave. The necrotic energy it emits is called “Entropy”: a potent force that clerics can harness to shield themselves from magic and annihilate arcane casters. The chained god Tharizdun claims this domain, while in Chessenta, a giant sphere of annihilation is worshipped as an aspect of Entropy itself. Cultists who wield the power go by many names: thaumatoclasts, entropomancers, or entropists.</p>

				<p>Rava, the Goddess of Gear, has blessed her followers with unusual powers, but she is not the only being in the multiverse that can grant the clockwork domain. Historical gods of blacksmiths such as Hephaestus/Vulcan, Govannon, or Gu can serve as patrons, as can mortals-turned-gods renowned for their engineering skill, like Daedalus. The emergence of clockworks in a society represents both a shit in magic and in thought, and the clockwork powers seek careful, dedicated, and unrelenting followers. They are guardians of order, progress, and industry. Some, the followers of evil gods, seek to grind everything under the ceaseless cogs of might, while followers of neutral or good clockwork gods seek instead to shape society under the belief that all beneit when everything works in harmony.</p>

				<p>The protection domain is the purview of deities who charge their followers to shield the weak from the strong. The gods’ faithful dwell in villages and towns on the borderlands, where they help bolster defenses and seek out evils to defeat. These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind. Deities who grant this domain include Helm, Ilmater, Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Paladine, Dol Dorn, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Yondalla, Athena, and Odin.</p>

				<p>The Twilight Domain governs the transition and blending of light into darkness. It is a time of rest and comfort, but also the threshold between safety and the unknown. Deities of healing or respite (such as Boldrei, Hestia, Mishakal, or Pelor), bravery or protection (such as Dol Arrah, Hajama, Helm, or Ilmater), travel or transition (such as Fharlanghn, Hermes, the Raven Queen, or the Traveler), or the night and dreams (such as Celestian, Morpheus, Nut, or Selûne) might grant their clerics the Twilight Domain. Clerics who serve these deities tend to be brave, delving into the dark to hold its dangers at bay and to bring comfort to those lost far from the light.</p>

				<p>Bontu has fully embraced this dictum, and though she expends little effort in teaching it, she surely leads by example. Her viziers subtly plant the seeds that flower into the ambition the God-Pharaoh desires. Through insinuation, they remind acolytes and initiates alike that achieving one’s place in the afterlife at the expense of others is not shameful, but is proof of the initiate’s determination and drive. Nothing is more important than that drive, they suggest—not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love. Not even devotion to a deity.</p>

				<p>It falls to Rhonas to instill this teaching in those who would enter the afterlife—but to his mind, the words themselves don’t matter. Strength can’t be taught. It must be built through practice and training. Rhonas demonstrates his teachings by his example, rather than by giving his students any kind of academic instruction. He welcomes the people of Naktamun to stand by the Hekma and watch him as he storms into the desert to battle the greatest horrors. He encourages them to observe his indomitable strength, for though they will never equal it, they can aspire to mimicry. He invites them to scrutinize every move and practice what they see</p>

				<p>The God-Pharaoh expects those he welcomes into the afterlife to desire it above all other pleasures and achievements, and for them to show their dedication, passion, and fervor through their actions. Hazoret is charged with cultivating this zeal in the initiates who come under her care, and she has undertaken the task with appropriate enthusiasm. She recognizes, however, that the best way to teach zeal is by demonstrating it.</p>

Other see themselves as liberators. They promise their followers that by offering their devotion to them, they will break the shackles of reason and reality that is holding their mind down, opening their mind to a whole new world of possibility. Cleric choosing this domain can sometimes find themselves lost in thoughts with themselves, rambling incoherently or debating the most outlandish subjects.

These gods value all of the arts, including music, painting, sculpting, and other skilled crafts, though they often specialize in one craft above the others. Clerics of a god of artistry are creative souls infused with the desire to create and share their emotions with others, whether through song, artwork, or other means. Many of their compositions are created or improved through magic, and are often a glorious sight to behold or listen to.</p>

				<p>The Courage domain focuses on personal heroics, and acts of valor and self-sacrifice. While the Courage domain bears many similarities to the War domain, it is more individualistic and isn’t directly connected to war. Clerics of this domain often take part in smaller conflicts, and focus on personal battles over grandois wars. Many war-like deities can claim influence over this domain, however, including Torm, Heironeous, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah. Gods of endurance and loss, such as Ilmater and Shar, can claim some influence over this domain as well, as they promote courage in the face of hardship. Regardless of their patron deity, clerics of this domain make for heroic warriors, eager to face their fears and fight against the odds to achieve their goals.</p>

				<p>Clerics of the Elemental domain are unique among their peers, as they often worship a group of deities, rather than focusing their prayers in the worship of only one god. This domain includes gods of fire, such as Kossuth or Sirrion, gods of water and oceans, such as Umberlee or Poseidon, gods of the earth, including Ulaa and Skadi, gods of air and storms, including Talos and Zeus, and other such deities. These clerics might devote themselves to any number of these gods, but they typically focus their worship on one or two of these deities, and specialize their magic accordingly. While some might train themselves in all them elemental magics equally, most clerics of this domain tend to value some elements above others. They might become masters of fire, devote themselves to learning the ins-and-outs of earth magic, or otherwise specialize Themselves. Gods of this domain tend to be less involved with their clerics than those of other domains, but when they give out a decree their followers are usually quick to respond.</p>

Deities of this domain include Malar, Balinor, Sekolah, Artemis, and Uller. While rangers are often the most common servants of these deities, most of gods of the hunt employ clerics as well. The clerics of a hunting god often take a more active role in advancing their god’s interests, compared to rangers.

Some of these gods are ruthless in their pursuit of justice, and are quick to enact retribution when crimes are committed, while others are more forgiving and open to punishments other than death. Clerics of this domain often act as judges, lawyers, and investigators, and are well respected by their compatriots and hated by their opponents and detractors.

				<p>For every light, there is a shadow equally dark. The divine powers are opposed in equal force by the foul things that lurk beyond the radiant grace of the sun, and it is in this balance between the forces of chaos, law, good, and evil that the mortal races can live and thrive. Such is the order of things, and thus, that balance must be protected. Ma’at, Tefnut, Shamash, Obatala, Rao, Cindor, Nemesis, and Adrestia, as well as other gods of justice, balance, equilibrium, vengeance, and peace may hold sway over the domain of balance. Your task, as an arbiter of these ancient gods, is to maintain the balance of the cosmic order by quelling what threats are within your power. Bring ruin where it is needed, and salvation where there is none to be found.</p>

You are tasked with providing protection and solace to those who join your cause, fostering friendship and unity among the members of your party as you work to end wars and conflicts.

				<p>At the midnight hour, when the sky is shrouded in shadow and the full moon’s light shines down upon the world, the arts sacred to the deities of witchcraft are practiced. Hecate, Hel, Circe, Abonde, Aradia, Nicneven, Leonard, Cerrunos, Oya, Cerridwen, Diana, and other gods and goddesses of darkness, magic, fear, death, nature, and eldritch forces lay claim to the domain of witchcraft. Servants of these deities learn of the wishes of their gods through the voice of a familiar, which instructs them in the esoteric rites of the faith. Call upon the arcana you have learned, cleric, and offer praise to the oldest and truest ways.</p>

				<p>Gods of the night - such as Selûne, Shar, Tharizdon, Takhisis, and Hecate - serve as both creators of light and harbingers of darkness, with moon goods focusing on the former and darkness gods on the latter. These gods serve as patrons of all alignments; their clerics serve as both righteous defenders of the weak, as well as deceptive thieves and assassins. Either way, these clerics excel in both melee combat and spellcasting, always using the cover of darkness to their advantage in both their battles and their attempts at subterfuge.</p>

Devouts of Civilization are leaders of small villages and sprawling metropolises, they are pioneers and settlers, taming the wilds in the name of order and society. Whether grand cathedrals or humble abbies, the gathering places of followers of Civilization gods tend to become the centers of communities.</p>

				<p>You have entered the service of one of the gods of poisoning, venom, and intoxication. These gods, which include Lolth, Dionysus, Talona, Achlys, and Zehir, value a variety of ideals, but all share a love of substances that twist the senses and damage the body. The burning pains of acidic venom, the dulled joy of drunkenness, and the potent sting of a snakebite all fall under this domain, as does the gleam of fluid on an assassins’ knife or the bubbling of a hag’s brew.</p>

				<p>Beauty is a concept that is interpreted differently by every culture, creed, and individual. For some it is an objective standard, unchanging and permanent. For others, true beauty must be fleeting and temporary to be appreciated. The beautiful can be used to uplift and inspire, but it can also be used to twist, control, and manipulate the naive.</p>
				<p class="indent">Clerics of Beauty recognize that most things are beautiful in their own way, and will go to great lengths to avoid bloodshed. When compelled to fight, Beauty clerics look to end conflicts quickly and decisively with powerful enchantment magic.</p>

				<p>Gods of the Poverty Domain value quality of their followers over quantity, and have strict requirements for their clerics. They are required to give up all rights to material possessions beyond basic necessities. Usually, clerics of Poverty are only armed with a quarterstaff, and only carry a small amount of food and water and the cloak on their back. These devotees are bound by divine law to seek peace above all, resorting to violence only when all other options have been exhausted.</p>
				<p class="indent">While followers of the Poverty Domain are few, they are among the most devout of clerics. Their ascetic way of life allows them to look beyond normal cares, and grants them a supernatural perspective beyond most mortal creatures.</p>

				<p>Followers of Shadow worship many gods. Some are gods of twilight and dusk that work in tandem with the forces of the natural world. Others are sinister gods worshiped by those that live deep underground, who fear and despise the light of day above all else. Whether good or evil, clerics of Shadow wield the darkness as an extension of themselves, using its power to sow fear and confusion. They blot out the light and instill terror in any who work against the will of their gods.</p>
