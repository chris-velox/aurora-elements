        <description>
            <p>The Way of the Boulder is a tradition as old as the mountains themselves. Dwelling in secluded monasteries on mountain peaks and deep in subterranean caverns, Boulder monks focus on becoming as large and immovable as the mountains that surround them. They grow in girth and size, and use their weight to land devastating blows.</p>
            <p class="indent">You seek to become solid imposing like the mountain peak, unmoving like bedrock, and fruitful like fertile soil. Boulder monks are often stubborn and inflexible in their thinking, and take a great deal of time to come to a decision.</p>

            <p>Initiates of the Sacred Inks spend years practicing celestial calligraphy. Once they are ready, the monks mark their bodies with increasingly complex celestial tattoos, granting them access to divine power. As the monk’s spiritual connection to the divine grows, so does the beauty of their celestial tattoos.</p>
            <p class="indent">Monks of this Monastic Tradition usually travel the world, supporting those who treasure beauty and kindling hope within those who have lost it. These Celestial warriors also do not hesitate to use their divine power to smite any who stand against them or their ideals.</p>

                <p>You have brought forth the true potential of your wild body. At 17th level, you learn one of the following disciplines:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Bestial Fury.</b> You can whip yourself into a primal fury when hunting your foes. When you score a critical hit against a creature with an unarmed strike, its speed is reduced to 0, and you have advantage on any unarmed strikes you make against that creature until the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Natural Resilience.</b> You can harden your exterior to deflect incoming blows. As a reaction, when you are hit by an attack, you can expend ki to increase your Armor Class until the start of your next turn. For each ki point you expend your Armor Class increases by 2, up to a maximum of 5 ki points.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Savage Rush.</b> You can draw upon primal speed to trample those in your path. As an action, you can expend 4 ki points and move up to your full movement speed in a straight line. Any creatures you pass through must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 8d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone on a failed save, and half damage on a success.</p>
