                    <li>You should expend Exploit Dice as an action to use it.</li>
                    <li>If it targets a single creature, it should deal damage equal to the Exploit Dice you spent + your Strength or Dexterity modifier in bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Consider adding a rider effect like stunned or blinded.</li>
                    <li>If it targets an area, reduce the damage of the Exploit accordingly. The larger the area, the less damage.</li>
                    <li>If it targets an area, it should force creatures in that area to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw based on the Exploit’s nauture to resist its effects.</li>

Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.</p>

			<p>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic—infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.</p>

Though trained to use weapons of all types, Guardians are especially effective when using a protective style of fighting with a weapon and shield. Alone, a Guardian is a small threat, but when fighting alongside their allies they are impenetrable walls of steel.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, the bargain you have struck with your Patron allows you to cast spells, much like a warlock does.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Cantrips.</b> You learn one cantrip of your choice from the warlock spell list. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional warlock cantrip of your choice.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b> The Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, as a 7th level Pact Warrior, you have two 2nd-level spell slots from your Pact Warrior Spellcasting. To cast the 1st-level spell hellish rebuke, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast hellish rebuke as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</b> You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell of your choice, which can be 1st or 2nd-level.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

                <p>Swordsage, blade master, sword saint; expert warriors who dedicate their lives to the art of war have had many names throughout history. Only drawing their weapon when they are prepared to kill, a Swordsage will only strike down their foe when necessary. They are always looking to improve their technique, mastering ever more impressive martial skills.</p>
                <p class="indent">Legends say that these reclusive masters take only one apprentice in their lifetime, passing on everything they know to a single student. Other folk tales tell of elusive sages who only take on the most promising young warriors. Whatever the origin of your skill, you are a Swordsage of legend, and your title inspires disbelief, fear, jealousy, and wonder.</p>

                <p>Your inventive arsenal can adjust to meet the challenges at hand. Starting at 15th level, at the end of a short rest, you can transfer a Schematic from one object to another, so long as the new object meets the prerequisites. If a Schematic has a limited amount of charges, the number of expended charges remains the same when transferred.</p>
