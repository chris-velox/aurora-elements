            <p>Those who walk the dark path of the Pact Warrior are driven by an overwhelming desire to destroy the great evils of the world. Those especially dedicated, those willing to give up anything, are often approached by Eldritch Powers, beings of otherworldly might. These mysterious and powerful benefactors offer great arcane power in return for a fraction of the warrior's soul or unquestioning fealty.</p>
            <p class="indent">Pact Warriors are pure utilitarians, willing to accept evil, so long as it leads to the destruction of what they perceive to be a greater evil. Willing to sacrifice their eternal soul for eldritch power, Pact Warriors are fearsome foes in battle.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, the bargain you have struck with your Patron allows you to cast spells, much like a warlock does.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Cantrips.</b> You learn one cantrip of your choice from the warlock spell list. Upon reaching 10th level in this class you learn one additional warlock cantrip of your choice.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b> The Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, as a 7th level Pact Warrior, you have two 2nd-level spell slots from your Pact Warrior Spellcasting. To cast the 1st-level spell hellish rebuke, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast hellish rebuke as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</b> You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell of your choice, which can be 1st or 2nd-level.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC, and when making a spell attack roll.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

            <p>The inventive warriors known as Tinker Knights seek an unorthodox form of martial skill. Rather than hone their physical abilities with the armaments of war, they look to augment their mundane physical abilities with mechanical inventions and innovative weaponry.</p>
            <p class="indent">Warriors adopt the archetype of the Tinker Knight for many reasons. Some have been grievously injured, and use their ingenuity to make up for their physical shortcomings. Others seek to put their sharp minds to use, but still desire to swing their sword and raise their shield on the front lines of the battlefield.</p>

			<p>The archetypal Cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.</p>

			<p>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic—infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.</p>

            <p class="indent">Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force. Many githyanki train to become such warriors, as do some of the most disciplined high elves. In the world of Eberron, many young kalashtar dream of becoming Psi Warriors.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a Psi Warrior, you might have honed your psionic abilities through solo discipline, unlocked it under the tutelage of a master, or refined it at an academy dedicated to wielding the mind's power as both weapon and shield.</p>

                <p>You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your superiority dice, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.</p>
                <p class="indent">Some of your powers expend the superiority die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended superiority die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your superiority dice increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).</p>

                <p class="indent"><b>Psionic Strike.</b> You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of you with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one superiority die, rolling it and dealing force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.</p>

As an action, you target one loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature, other than yourself. If you can see the target and it is within 30 feet of you, you can move it up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if it is a Tiny object, you can move it to or from your hand. Either way, you can move the target horizontally, vertically, or both.

            <p class="indent">Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters can be found among any family of giants, and you likely learned your methods first or second hand from such a mystical artisan. Whether you found the giant's work carved into a hill or cave, learned of the runes from a sage, or met the giant in person, you studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower your equipment.</p>
