                <p>For centuries chroniclers and librarians have sought the best way to store vast troves of information. While most were satisfied with scrolls, tomes, and books, the first archivists strove for something greater, storing libraries worth of information in one solitary object, and created the first artificial minds. As an archivist, you are on the cutting edge of arcane advancement. Like all new breakthroughs, you must be careful with who you allow to witness this ability. How will you use your fringe ability to create artificial intelligence?</p>

Biomancers are those who use their talents to supplement their own anatomy and create life. Combining necromancy and transmutation magic, Biomancers see all living things as prototypes that can be magically evolved.</p>

                        <li>You can use your Intelligence, in place of Strength or Dexterity, for attack and damage rolls with the weapon.</li>
