            <p>Guardians are elite fighters whose true strength shows when defending or fighting side by side with an ally. Skilled with weapons of all types, they are especially deadly with a protective style of fighting that utilizes a weapon and shield. They coordinate their tactics with their allies, becoming a deadly unit on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">When alone, Guardians are a minor threat, but when standing beside powerful allies they become impenetrable walls of flesh and steel. If a Guardian chooses to block your path, it is best to find another way around.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Beginning at 3rd level, your skills as a Guardian allow you to defend nearby allies. While you are wielding a shield, you can enter a defensive stance as a bonus action on your turn. While in this stance, your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet, and you, and creatures of your choice within 5 feet, gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Your stance only ends if you fall unconscious, or end it as a bonus action.</p>
                <p class="indent">While you in your defensive stance, you gain access to the following defensive actions detailed below:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Brace.</b> As a reaction, when you, or a creature within your defensive stance, is forced to make a saving throw to resist being grappled, moved against their will, or knocked prone, you can grant that creature advantage on their roll.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Intercept.</b> As a reaction, when a creature within the range of your defensive stance is hit by an attack, you can interpose yourself between them and the attack. If the triggering attack would meet or exceed your Armor Class, you take damage as if you had been the original target.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Shield Bash.</b> When you take the attack action, you can use a bonus action on that same turn to attack a creature within 5 feet with your shield. On hit, your shield attack deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier.</p>

            <p>While all fighters have skill with ranged weapons, some dedicate themselves exclusively to improving their accuracy and precision with the bow.

            <p class="indent">No matter their weapon of choice, all marksmen back up their deadly marksmanship with unshakable confidence and an unmistakable swagger. Confident in the speed, accuracy, and precision of their shots, there are few challenges a true marksman cannot overcome.</p>

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</b> At 3rd level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st or 2nd-level. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

            <p>Those that fit under the archetype of the Tinker Knight seek an unorthodox form of martial prowess. Rather than hone their body into a weapon, they look to augment their physical ability with mechanical inventions and innovative weaponry. Though they spend most of their time theorizing, tinkering, and experimenting, Tinker Knights and their inventive arsenals are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">Warriors follow the path of the Tinker Knight for many reasons. Some have been grievously injured, and they use their ingenuity to make up for their physical shortcomings. Others seek to put their sharp minds to use, but still desire to swing their sword and hoist their shield on the front lines.</p>
