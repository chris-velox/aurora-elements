            <p>Pure utilitarians driven by an overwhelming need to destroy great evils of the world are sometimes offered great power in return for a fraction of their soul. Those who agree to this dire bargain are known as Pact Warriors. They give part of themselves over to these powerful unknown benefactors who impart them with a small portion of their arcane power.</p>

                <p>Subclasses that grant martial characters access to spellcasting, like the Blood Hunter’s Order of the Profane Soul, can easily upset the balance of the game. However, the archetype of a warrior who offers part of themselves for eldritch power is thematically powerful. The Pact Warrior is an attempt to bring this archetype into the game while abiding by the design goals of 5e.</p>

                <p>Beginning at 3rd level, your bargain with an eldritch power allows you to cast spells much like a warlock does.</p>
                <p class="indent">Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Spell Slots. The Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. At 3rd level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Pact Warrior Spellcasting table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st-level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st or 2nd-level. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast, and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
