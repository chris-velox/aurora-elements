        <description>
            <p>The slender elf cleaned her glasses with the corner of her cloak, as the dust began to settle around her. Her benefactor had paid her a handsome sum to locate this forgotten place, and after months of pouring over ancient tomes, she finally pieced together it's long-lost location. Now, she had a difficult choice to make. If she reported her findings to her benefactor, the temple would be stripped of its valuables. If she kept the location of her discovery hidden, then she could preserve the priceless knowledge contained within. For to a savant, knowledge is more precious then gold coins.</p>
            <p class="indent">The elderly human warrior assessed the state of the soldiers under his command. They were exhausted and almost out of supplies. It was the tenth day of the siege, and the old warrior knew in his heart that no reinforcements would be coming to save them. He was too old to be of much use in battle, but if his soldiers followed his orders to the letter, and without hesitation, they just might have a fighting chance. He stood up, and for what could be the last time, donned his shield and drew his sword from its scabbard.</p>
            <p class="indent">A young dwarf bent over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands were shaking as he examined the unconscious soldier's wounds. The elders of his clan had spent a great deal of their fortune to send him to the best university gold could buy. All those hours spent in lectures, libraries, and observation, all for this moment. He thought back to all he had learned about field medicine and began to dress his comrade's wounds.</p>
            <h4>MAGNIFICENT MINDS</h4>
            <p>There are many intelligent people in the world, but few are true savants. Born with an innate desire to learn all they can, and the potential for a genius level intellect, savants spend their lives studying anything that those around them are willing to teach. Often recognized at an early age, their ravenous hunger for knowledge, draws them to great libraries, universities, and other places of higher learning. Willing to go to any lengths to access the hidden knowledge of the world, savants often turn to a life of adventuring. For a savant, no price is too steep to pay for a new discovery.</p>
            <p class="indent">Despite their aptitude for learning, most savants seek to better themselves without having to depend other forces. Rejecting the patronage of powerful beings, and considering wizardry a shortcut to power, savants rely on their intellect alone, as they strive for perfection.</p>
            <h4>INTENSELY FOCUSED</h4>
            <p>Savants hyper-focus on their area of academic study. They obsess and learn all they can about their area of expertise. This drive fuels every savant, and they are willing to put aside political, religious, or cultural divisions in order to learn. Once they have learned all academia can teach them, savants strike out into the world to advance their field of study .</p>
            <p class="indent">Often at great cost to themselves, a savant will not stop researching, experimenting, and theorizing until they have made an indelible mark on their academic discipline. Whether they realize it or not, the ultimate goal burning within the heart of every savant is to uncover some lost or previously unknown truth about the universe.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SAVANT</h4>
            <p>When creating your savant, consider their upbringing and level of formal education. Were they the star pupil of the kingdom's university, or did they come from squal, fighting for any scrap of knowledge they could get their hands on? Consider why they became an adventurer rather than an academic. Have they advanced beyond study and look to the endless discoveries of a life of adventure?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a savant quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the noble or sage background from the Player's Handbook.</p>
            <h5>OPTIONAL RULE: MULTICLASSING</h5>
            <p>If your group uses the optional rule for multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the savant as one of your classes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a 13 in Intelligence to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are a savant.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies Gained.</i></b> If savant isn't your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a savant: one skill from the savant skill list and one set of artisan's tools of your choice.</p>

                <p class="indent"><b><i>Disorient.</i></b> You speak a word of power that weakens the place of a creature in reality. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must subtract your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) from all saving throws it makes before the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Exhaust.</i></b> You speak a word of power that drains the vitality of a foe. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target gains one level of exhaustion. If a creature has at least one level of exhaustion from this feature it can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

                <p>When you reach 13th level, your knowledge of medicine allows you to perform greater feats of healing, both on and off the battlefield. You gain access to the following additional options for your Combat Medic feature:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Restorative Boost.</i></b> You touch a humanoid creature and alleviate a debilitating effect. You end any reduction to one of the target's ability scores, end an effect reducing the target's hit point maximum, reduce its exhaustion level by one, or end one of the following conditions on it: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Resuscitate.</i></b> You touch a humanoid creature that has died within the last minute. It is returned to life with 1 hit point as if you had cast the revivify spell on the creature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you use one of these Combat Medic options, you can't use either again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>

            <p>In every society there are those that look to deceive, swindle, and take advantage of common trust — thieves' guilds that run racketeering schemes, monsters that can shift their form to trick the innocent, and those who abuse their legitimate authority for personal gain. Standing in their way is the archetypal Seeker, those who use their considerable intellect to outwit any who obfuscate the truth.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a Seeker, you excel at uncovering secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at rooting out monsters that hide among, and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of observation and your keen wit make you well equipped to expose, and defeat, hidden evils.</p>

                <p>Most official classes in Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e have a subclass whose theme and mechanics reinforce the base identity of the class. Like the Champion fighter, the Thief rogue, or the Life Domain cleric, the Seeker serves this role for the savant. This Academic Discipline doubles down on the identity of the savant and its base class features without adding too much complexity.</p>
