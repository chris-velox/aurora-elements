        <description>
            <p>An elderly human watched as his young apprentice struggle to lift the small stone with his mind. He couldn't help but think back to his own youth, and the years of training it had taken to hone the strange power within himself. For years he worked to manifest his psionic abilities, and once he had mastered the basic mental disciplines, he set out on a life of adventure. After many moons, he came to realize that true enlightenment could only be found within, and he retreated to the remote cave he now called home. His remaining years were growing fewer in number, and it was now his duty to pass on what he had learned to another with the potential for psionic enlightenment.</p>
            <p class="indent">Selected at birth due to her psionic potential, and raised in solitude to be the perfect warrior, the young elf had been given her first mission. Using her mystical power, she had shrunk down to the size of a mouse and slipped through the gate and past the baron's guards with ease. The baron now struggled beneath her, his knife unable to find purchase in her psionically hardened skin. The baron let out a soft cry as the elf's hand became a blade that pierced his heart. The next morning, his guards would find the baron dead, though his body bore no signs of trauma. His cause of death would forever remain a mystery.</p>
            <p class="indent">The young grey dwarf fled into the forest, filled with the terror of what he had done. For as long as he could remember, there was something inside him that he had struggled to keep from escaping. As the years passed, it became harder and harder to prevent this alien force from overwhelming him. That morning, in a brief moment of weakness, his control slipped, and a torrent of wild psionic power erupted from within his mind. He had awoken in the rubble of his clan’s ancestral home to find his family buried in the wreckage. Somewhere, deep down, he had always known that this power would break free, and now he had paid the price. He would live out his remaining years in the wild, where his power couldn’t harm anyone else.</p>
            <h4>WONDROUS POWER</h4>
            <p>Whether through years of practice, or a once in a generation innate talent, psions learn to manipulate the world with the wondrous power of their minds. Drawing on the mystical power within themselves, they can communicate without speaking, move objects, alter their physical bodies, and even manifest spells, all with their psionic power. Relying solely on their mastery of their mind, psions can perform feats considered impossible, even by the most erudite wizards and devout clerics. For psions, it is a point of great pride that they can produce wonders without the help of external power.</p>
            <p class="indent">The way psions learn to channel this strange talent affects the nature of their abilities. For some, they hone their gift to a fine point through years of practice, determination, and meditation. Others use their mystic potential to morph their bodies into deadly weapons. And for the rare few who attempt to stifle their power, they risk outbursts of wild psionic energy that can have devastating consequences.</p>
            <h4>RECLUSIVE MYSTICS</h4>
            <p>Due to their frightening potential, psions are often misunderstood and feared by the common folk. If they don’t learn to control their power, their strange abilities can leave them shunned, and even hated, by the people around them. Looking to avoid judgment and fear, psions rarely reveal their abilities unless absolutely necessary, and are hesitant to place their trust in others. If they are lucky, potential psions will be discovered by a master and taken away from their home to hone their mind in seclusion. No matter their philosophy on life, all psions hold it as their sacred duty to eventually take on an apprentice with the gift, and teach them to control their power, passing on everything they themselves have learned.</p>
            <h4>CREATING YOUR PSION</h4>
            <p>When you create your psion, consider when you first discovered your psionic potential. Did another psion take you under their wing, teaching you to control your wondrous power as their apprentice? Were you forced to learn to wield your mysterious power on your own? Were you born with psionic potential, or did you have a mystical experience that awoke something previously dormant inside you?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a psion quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the guidance and mind thrust cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells catapult and dissonant whispers.</p>
            <h5>OPTIONAL RULE: MULTICLASSING</h5>
            <p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if you choose the psion as one of your classes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a 13 in Intelligence to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are a psion.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> If psion isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, and in one skill of your choice from the psion skill list.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting.</i></b> If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class features from another class, you can use the psi points you gain from your Psionics feature to cast spells from other classes, and you can use any spell slots you gain from other classes to cast spells you know from the psion class.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a psion, you gain the following class features.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Psionic power, though it always comes from within the user, can manifest itself into the world in different ways. Psions are grouped into informal groups, known as esoteric orders, based on how they draw out and wield their inner power. At 1st level, you choose an esoteric order that best represents your psion from one of the following options: Order of the Empath, Order of the Enlightened, Order of the Immortal, Order of the Outsider, or Order of the Wilder.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your choice grants you features when you select it at 1st level and again at 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
                <h5>Order Disciplines</h5>
                <p>Your Esoteric Order predisposes you to certain psionic powers known as Mental Disciplines. You gain one of the disciplines presented in your subclass description. When you gain the Mental Discipline feature at 2nd level, this discipline doesn't count against your number of Disciplines Known.</p>
                <h5>Order Spells</h5>
                <p>Each esoteric order has a list of Order Spells that you gain at the levels noted in your esoteric order description. These spells don't count against your number of Spells Known, and spells you learn from this feature cannot be replaced.</p>

            <description>
                <p>You have awakened the wondrous psionic power of your mind. Starting at 1st level, this innate psionic power allows you to manifest spells into the world. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of Spellcasting, and the end of this class description for the psion spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two psion cantrips of your choice. You learn an additional psion cantrip at 4th level and 10th level.</p>
                <h5>PSI POINTS</h5>
                <p>The Psion table shows how many psi points you have to manifest your psion spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these psion spells, you must expend the amount of psi points indicated in the table below. Your psi points are a representation of your mental stamina, and you restore your psionic ability through rest and meditation. You regain all expended psi points when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, as a 3rd level psion, you can cast the spell <i>dissonant whispers</i> at 2nd-level by spending 2 psi points.</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Point Cost</td><td>Spell Level</td><td>Point Cost</td></tr>

                    <tr><td>Cantrip</td><td>0</td><td>3rd</td><td>3</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>1st</td><td>1</td><td>4th</td><td>4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>2nd</td><td>2</td><td>5th</td><td>5</td></tr>
                </table>
                <h5>MENTAL LIMIT</h5>
                <p>Your psion level limits the potency of spells that you can manifest with your psionics. This is reflected in the Mental Limit column of the Psion Table. For example, as a 5th level psion, you are limited to casting spells of 3rd-level or lower.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the psion spell list. The Spells Known column of the psion table shows when you learn more psion spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level equal to your Mental Limit or lower. For instance, when you reach 3rd level, you can learn one new psion spell of 1st or 2nd-level.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a psion level, you can choose one psion spell you know and replace it with another spell from the psion spell list, equal to, or lower than, your Mental Limit.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for any spells you cast with psionics, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psion spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>The power of your mind produces your spells, and serves as your spellcasting focus. Though, you must have at least one free hand to satisfy the material and somatic components of a spell, as long as those components do not have a gold cost. Components with a gold cost must still be provided.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you cast a spell using psionics, you manifest noticeable changes. Whether your eyes glow with the strange light of the far realm, or your physical form phases into the astral plane, creatures are aware that you are wielding some sort of power, unless one of your features says otherwise.</p>
            </description>

            <description>
                <p>In the solace of your training, you have honed wonderful and strange psionic abilities beyond the grasp of most mortals. At 2nd level, you learn one mental discipline of your choice from the list at the end of this class description. As you gain levels in this class, you learn additional mental disciplines, as shown in the Disciplines Known column of the Psion Table.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the mental disciplines you have mastered and replace it with another discipline for which you meet the prerequisites. You cannot replace a mental discipline that is a prerequisite for another discipline that you currently know.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, when you reach 6th level in this class, you cannot choose to replace the Celerity I discipline if you also know the Celerity II discipline, as you would be removing a prerequisite mental discipline for Celerity II.</p>
                <h5>Mental Disciplines</h5>
                <p>Listed below are the mental disciplines available to a psion. Each time you learn a discipline you choose one listed below, for which you meet the prerequisites, and you gain the lowest level feature that you do not already have. For example, if you select the Celerity discipline at 2nd level, you gain the features of Celerity I. If you then select the Celerity discipline again at 5th level, you'd gain the benefits of Celerity II.</p>
                <p class="indent">No matter the mental discipline, the tiers all have the same psion level prerequisites. You must be at lest a 5th level psion to gain the benefits of a Tier II discipline feature, an 11th level psion for a Tier III discipline, and a 16th level psion for a Tier IV discipline. You can learn a mental discipline feature at the same time you meet its psion level prerequisite.</p>

                <p>As you unlock the latent power within yourself, you learn to manifest feats of overwhelming mystical power from deep within your psyche. At 11th level, one such powerful ability manifests as a mystic devotion, a psionic spell of wondrous power. Choose one spell of 6th-level or lower from the psion spell list to be your 6th-level mystic devotion spell.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can psionically manifest this spell once, at 6th-level, without expending psi points, and you regain the use of that mystic devotion spell when you finish a long rest.</p>

In order to select a psion spell of 5th-level or lower as a mystic devotion spell, it must be able to be up-cast at the level of that mystic devotion slot, and you cannot manifest that spell with your psi points unless you also select it as one of your psion Spells Known.</p>
                <p class="indent">As you gain levels as a psion, you unlock more powerful mystic devotion spells as detailed in the Psion Table.: one 7th-level psion spell at 13th level, one 8th-level psion spell at 15th level, and finally, one 9th-level psion spell at 17th level.</p>

Enhancing their physical form with the power of their mind, they can perform great feats of athleticism and martial skill.

Often manifesting their powers unexpectedly as a result of a mystical event, or attempting to contain their psionic potential, Wilders are as unpredictable as they are powerful, and they rarely have psionic masters. By the time their overwhelming psionic abilities develop, it is too late to teach them another path.</p>
