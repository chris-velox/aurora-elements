                <p>Paladins who swear the Oath of Beauty hold themselves to a lofty standard of excellence. They strive to appear as beautiful gleaming beacons of elegance. Some use the power of their graceful visage to inspire and give hope to the downtrodden. Others turn inwards and become obsessed with their appearance and standing in society, using the power of their Oath to seduce, deceive, and intimidate those beneath them.</p>

                <p>Since the dawn of time the mortal world has been plagued by the scourge that is undeath. Created by dark emotions and malicious magic, ghosts, ghouls, and undead of all sorts have plagued the mortal races since they took their first steps.</p>
                <p class="indent">As ancient as this threat itself, a brotherhood of paladins known as Exorcists have protected the living from the dead. Willing to sacrifice their very selves, these warriors taint their soul with the foul magic of undeath. Once mastered, they use their dark powers to drive back the darkness itself. Giving up any chance of a normal life, Exorcists work tirelessly to prevent the tide of undeath from overwhelming the living.</p>
