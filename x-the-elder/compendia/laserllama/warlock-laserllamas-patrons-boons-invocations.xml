            <p>For those with the willpower and time, arcane magic can be a path to great power. Those who ascend to these lofty heights of arcane power are known as Archmages, masters of the weave. So wondrous is their power, and so strange are their goals, these masters of magic will sometimes enlist warlocks to help with, what appear to the Archmage, to be trivial tasks.</p>
            <p class="indent">What drove you into the service of an Archmage? Was it a desire for their power, or a simpler path to arcane mastery?</p>

            <p>Grandmother, auntie, wood witch, medicine woman, crone; the strange creatures known as hags go by many names. Their motivations are often sinister, and they delight in the suffering of others. When hags gather and form a magic pact, known as a Coven, they gain access to power beyond what any of them could hope to achieve individually. Together, their ability to sow pain increases tenfold. What strange bargain have you made to access the Coven's unorthodox magic?</p>

Eldest of all plant life, ancient trees, sacred groves, and sentient forests can remember an age when plants, not mortals or beasts, dominated the land. These ancient beings are known as Primeval Growths, the power limited only by the roots that hold them in place.</p>
            <p class="indent">Able to channel elder nature magic, these ancient beings lend their power to mortals who have the ability to move about the world, and can work to enact their primal will.</p>

            <p>The Wild Hunt is a strange phenomenon that takes hold of mortals, driving them to track and kill whatever poor creature they perceive to be their prey. The source of this phenomenon is unclear, but legends tell of raiding parties from the Feywild that draw unsuspecting mortals into their hunt, or of individuals cursed by dark druidic magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">While its exact origins are unclear, mortals who are bound to this force by a pact start to take on the strange and unusual characteristics of the Feywild; sprouting antlers and their ears growing pointed. As their appearance changes, they slowly lose who they are, becoming one with the Wild Hunt.</p>

                <p>Your patron has gifted you a mystical cloak to shield you from harm and hide your movements. As an action on your turn, you can summon your pact shroud, which takes the form of a robe or cloak of your choice. While wearing your pact shroud, you are considered invisible while obscured by shadows, darkness, or other natural phenomenon such as fog or mist.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your pact shroud disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute, if you use this feature again, if you dismiss your shroud (no action required), or if you die.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can bond a magic robe or cloak as your pact shroud by performing a ritual over a short or long rest. Once bonded, you can shunt it to an extradimensional space, or summon it, as an action. You cannot bond artifacts or sentient clothing, and you can only have one pact shroud at a time.</p>
