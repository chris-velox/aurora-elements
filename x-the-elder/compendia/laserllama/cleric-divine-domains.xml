        <description>
            <p>Beauty is a concept that is interpreted differently by every culture, creed, and individual. For some it is an objective standard, unchanging and permanent. For others, true beauty must be fleeting and temporary to be appreciated. The beautiful can be used to uplift and inspire, but it can also be used to twist, control, and manipulate the naive.</p>
            <p class="indent">Clerics of Beauty recognize that most things are beautiful in their own way, and will go to great lengths to avoid bloodshed. When compelled to fight, Beauty clerics look to end conflicts quickly and decisively with powerful enchantment magic.</p>

            <p>Blood magic is one of the most ancient forms of divine power. Clerics that serve gods of this Domain draw upon the primal power of life-blood to perform great and terrible feats. When there are no creatures from which to draw life-blood, these Clerics must sacrifice their own vitality to work their magic. Blood Clerics most often serve gods that revel in suffering, but some wield this ancient power to serve noble ends.</p>

            <p>Clerics that serve the fickle and spontaneous gods of Luck rarely resemble traditional clerics. Their holy symbols are usually sets of dice, pieces from gaming sets, or strange lucky charms. Luck clerics believe they earn favor with their god each time they leave their life in the hands of fate.</p>
            <p class="indent">For those who embrace the Luck Domain, the greater the risk, the greater the thrill. Gambling with their lives brings great joy, and they live to encourage rash decisions in others.</p>

            <p>While almost all clerics draw their power from worship of a specific god, there are secretive sects of hermits that derive their power from their belief in themselves. They spend their lives in quiet solitude, mastering their minds and striving for enlightenment. After years of training and meditation, these monastic masters are able to awaken their mind's eye, the psionic potential within them. Using this inner power, they can produce divine magic, much like a traditional cleric.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once awakened, these psionic clerics often feel compelled to use their gifts for the benefit of all. They are often found wandering the countryside, helping all they meet strive for an enlightened way of life in harmony with those around them.</p>

            <p>Gods of the Poverty Domain value quality of their followers over quantity, and have strict requirements for their clerics. They are required to give up all rights to material possessions beyond basic necessities. Usually, clerics of Poverty are only armed with a quarterstaff, and only carry a small amount of food and water and the cloak on their back. These devotees are bound by divine law to seek peace above all, resorting to violence only when all other options have been exhausted.</p>
            <p class="indent">While followers of the Poverty Domain are few, they are among the most devout of clerics. Their ascetic way of life allows them to look beyond normal cares, and grants them a supernatural perspective beyond most mortal creatures.</p>

Others are sinister gods worshiped by those that live deep underground, who fear and despise the light of day above all else. Whether good or evil, clerics of Shadow wield the darkness as an extension of themselves, using its power to sow fear and confusion. They blot out the light and instill terror in any who work against the will of their gods.</p>
