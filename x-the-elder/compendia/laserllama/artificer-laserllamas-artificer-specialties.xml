            <p>One of the most dangerous obsessions an artificer can pursue has always been mechanical flight. Many strive for this lofty goal, and all but the most dedicated, and often the most foolhardy, artificers fail in their pursuits. Experiments that end in disastrous explosions, catastrophic falls from the sky, and deadly malfunctions are not out of the norm for an Aeronaut perfecting their mechanical flying machine.</p>
            <p class="indent">You constantly strive to achieve the lofty goal of every Aeronaut, the creation of an arcane flying machine.</p>

At the end of a long rest, as long as you have access to your woodcarver’s tools, you can construct a personal flying machine. You determine its appearance, and it can be used as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. You cannot operate your flying machine while wearing heavy armor or while you have a shield or heavy weapon equipped.

This flight lasts until the end of your current turn, at which point you fall to the ground unless you have a way to remain airborne.

            <p>For centuries chroniclers and librarians have sought the best way to store vast troves of information. While most were satisfied with scrolls, tomes, and books, the first archivists strove for something greater, storing libraries worth of information in one solitary object, and created the first artificial minds. As an archivist, you are on the cutting edge of arcane advancement. Like all new breakthroughs, you must be careful with who you allow to witness this ability. How will you use your fringe ability to create artificial intelligence?</p>

            <p>Behind every great musician, every standing ovation, every sold out concert, there is someone who put quill to parchment and penned the notes. These great minds are known as composers. Unlike other bards and entertainers, composers take a more mathematical and cerebral approach to music and song. They are masters of patterns that go unnoticed, and when they apply their analytical minds to a problem it is only a matter of time before they find a solution.</p>
