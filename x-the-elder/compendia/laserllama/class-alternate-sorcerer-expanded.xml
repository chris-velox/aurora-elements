            <p>Every so often, a mortal catches the attention of a powerful lord or lady of the Fey. Often the object of affection or the offspring of this relationship is gifted arcane power beyond that of most mortal beings. However, these infatuations are often short-lived, and the mortals are left to learn to use their power with little supervision or instruction. Weather you were born of such a relationship, grew up near a Crossroads, or were chosen by a powerful Fey creature, you have been blessed with the changing and chaotic power of the Feywild.</p>

Ironmongers are formidable foes, and are sought after by captains and conquerers for their ability to turn the tide of any battle, no matter how hopeless.</p>

			<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</p>

			<p>Sometimes the spark of magic that fuels a sorcerer comes from a divine source that glimmers within the soul. Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</p>
			<p class="indent">A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.</p>
			<p class="indent">In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.</p>

                <p>You can call forth a creature of darkness. As a bonus action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. It uses the dire wolf’s statistics from the Monster Manual, with the following changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The beast is size Medium, and counts as a monstrosity.</li>
                    <li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>
                    <li>It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The beast takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
                    <li>At the start of its turn, the beast automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. It shares your initiative and takes its turn immediately after you. On its turn, it can move only toward, and make attacks against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, they have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</p>

                    <p>When you summon your beast of ill omen you determine its appearance. Like a wizard’s familiar, the beast you conjure takes on a shape that reflects your inner self. An unhinged sorcerer may conjure an emaciated wolf, while an apathetic sorcerer may conjure an aloof feline creature.</p>

			<p>An alien influence has wrapped its tendrils around your mind, giving you psionic power. You can now touch other minds with that power and alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?</p>
			<p class="indent">As an Aberrant Mind sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them? Or did an event later in life leave you shining with psionic awareness? Consult the Aberrant Origins table for a possible origin of your power.</p>

				<tr><td>2</td><td>A psychic wind from the Astral Plane carried psionic energy to you. When you use your powers, faint motes of light sparkle around you.</td></tr>
