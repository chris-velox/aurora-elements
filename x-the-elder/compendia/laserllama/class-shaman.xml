        <description>
			<p>A female half-orc lumbers through the forest, her primal tattoos glistening in the light of the moon. A child from her tribe had seen a group of hobgoblins cutting lumber from their sacred grove of trees. Slicing her hand, the half-orc used her dark blood to inscribe a glyph on a the hilt of her greatclub. The weapon began to pulse with a deep green aura as she ventured forth to deal with the foolish hobgoblins that had dared profane the sacred grove of her tribe. For desecrating the holy place of her ancestors, they would pay with their lives.</p>
			<p class="indent">A hunched over, elderly halfling grips his necklace as he faces down the massive ogre who had come to threaten his village. The necklace, made from the finger bones of the villiage’s previous shamans, allowed their spirits to empower his aging body. Drawing upon the power of his predecessors, he could once again move with the vigor of his youth. Quick as lightning, he struck the ogre’s head with the ceremonial quarterstaff that marked him as the elder of his people. As his foe’s body slumped to the ground, he reflected on his time defending his people as their champion. Soon his time would come to an end, and his body would rejoin the earth. However, his spirit would live on, joining the previous elders, providing aid forever.</p>
			<p class="indent">In the dark of night, a thin elvish woman used her connection to magic of creation to conduct a dark ritual on a stolen lock of hair. The next morning, far across town, the village fool came down with a mysterious illness, and within hours he had succumbed to the strange pox. The townsfolk suspected dark magic was at play, but after a few days they buried the fool and moved on. The man who had dared to insult the crone had paid the price for his sharp words.</p>
			<h4>CONDUITS OF PRIMAL ENERGY</h4>
			<p>Every living thing, plants, animals, and even the landscape, is suffused with the magic of creation. Shamans are the rare few that learn to draw upon that natural energy that flows through all life. After opening themselves up to this power they are able to mold this primal energy to enhance and change the shape of their bodies, place strange curses on their foes, shape the landscape, wield the raw power of the elements, and heal the sick. The practice of shamanistic magic is ancient in origin, and traces its roots back to the dawn of creation. Since the beginning, shamans have passed their teachings and traditions from one generation to the next in an unending chain of sages.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some say that shamanistic magic is older then the divine magic of the gods, and more powerful then the arcane magic of the most well-studied wizards. However, those that understand this power are rare. Shamans overwhelmingly embrace the old ways of the world. They find themselves uncomfortable in civilized society, instead preferring to dwell in the wild where their connection to nature is strongest.</p>
			<h4>POWER OVERWHELMING</h4>
			<p>Unlike most spellcasters, shamans don’t come to learn their magic through study or devotion. Through meditation and introspection they learn to tap into the raw energy of creation innate in all living things. Once they open themselves, their connection to the power of the natural world is intense, and shamans constantly run the risk of being overwhelmed by the magic they wield. Many who attempt to follow the way of the shaman are consumed by the life-energy they draw into themselves, irrevocably transforming into large trees or stalagmites that vaguely resemble their original form.</p>
			<p class="indent">But, for the few that strike a balance between themselves and this power, they are able to wield the primal magic that was instrumental in the creation of the multiverse. They walk the land, mediating the eternal struggle between humanoid races and the wild beast and plants of the world.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A SHAMAN</h4>
			<p>When creating your shaman, consider how you came to be a conduit for the power of creation. Were you trained from birth to be the elder of your tribe, destined to bear the power that comes with the spiritual support of your ancestors? Did a terrible hag steal you away and raise you in her ways, teaching you the secrets of curses and hex magic? Or did you study under an ancient hermit, learning to manipulate the energy present in all things in order to heal the broken?</p>
			<p class="indent">Whatever your origin, consider how your relationship to the natural world effects your character. Do you gently beseech the power of nature? Or do you violently wrest control of the primeval creative energies around you?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a shaman quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom your highest ability score followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, select the shillelagh and vicious mockery cantrips along with the 1st-level spells entangle and heroism.</p>

			<description>
				<p>You have learned to draw upon your connection to primordial power of nature to cast spells. See chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this class description for the shaman spell list.</p>
				<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
				<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the shaman spell list at the end of this class description You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.</p>
				<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
				<p>The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of these spell slots. All of your spell slots are of the same level. To cast one of your shaman spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
				<p class="indent">For example, as a 5th level shaman, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
				<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
				<p>When you gain your Primal Magic at 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the shaman spell list.</p>
				<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Shaman table shows when you learn more shaman spells of your choice of 1st-level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new shaman spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level.</p>
				<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shaman spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shaman spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
				<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
				<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
				<p>You can use a shamanistic fetish as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells. See the Shamanistic Fetishes note below for a list of objects that count as a shamanistic fetish.</p>
				<div class="sidebar">
					<h5 class="caption">Shamanistic Fetishes</h5>
					<p>When a shaman casts a spell, they must be careful not to be consumed by the power they draw upon. For this reason, their spellcasting focus, known as a shamanistic fetish, must be a mundane item of personal significance worth at least 1 gp.</p>
				</div>
				<h5>SPELL VERSATILITY</h5>
				<p>At the end of a long rest, you can perform a short meditation, and replace one shaman spell you know from your Primal Magic feature with another spell from the shaman spell list of a level equal to, or lower then, your Slot Level.</p>
				<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
				<p>You can cast any shaman spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

			<p>While most shamans draw upon life giving energy of creation to create and heal, some twist their connection, using it to hinder and hex their foes. Curse Binders are masters of this foul side of shamanism. Often the students of vile hags, or dark beings from the shadowfell, these dark shamans use forbidden techniques to twist a creature’s own life essence against them. Their familiarity with dark magic allows Curse Binders to protect themselves against hexes, blights, and other dark magics they confront.</p>

			<p>Since the dawn of time mortals have communed with the spirits of the deceased. Turning to them for guidance in the present, stories of the past, and glimpses of the future. Some shamans allow the spirits to work through their bodies, granting them the martial prowess of warriors long dead. Known as Spirit Warriors, these shamans are often found guarding sacred places, hidden from civilization.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sprit Warriors make stalwart allies and terrible foes, and woe to those who would rouse these ancient protectors to action. Fighting in tandem with the spirits of the world around them, Spirit Warriors gain enhanced physical and spiritual abilities, some which may seem unnatural.</p>

While most of these tales are nothing more then local legends with no basis in reality, some are inspired by the bestial shamans known as Wild Hearts.</p>

				<p>Your kinship with the animals of the land allows you to take on the form of a great beast. Starting at 3rd level, you can expend one of your Primal Magic spell slots to transform into a great beast, using the Great Beast stat bock, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. When you transform you choose one bestial trait from the list at the end of this spirituality. You determine the appearance of your great beast, but its appearance has no effect on its abilities. While you are transformed the following rules apply:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You use the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the great beast, but you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies.</li>
					<li>You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the great beast. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert because you dropped to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.</li>
					<li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell.</li>
					<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
					<li>Any equipment you are wearing or carrying merges into your great beast form. Equipment that merges with your great beast form has no effect while transformed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="indent">Your great beast form lasts for one hour. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another Primal Magic spell slot. You revert to your normal form if you use a bonus action to do so, fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>

                    <p>When you use your Primal Wild Shape to transform into a great beast, you determine some of the beast’s characteristics. Each time you transform, choose the appropriate number of bestial traits from the list below.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Aggressive.</i></b> As a bonus action, the great beast can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Charge.</i></b> If the great beast moves at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a target and then hits it with a Rend attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 slashing damage. If the target is a creature it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your shaman spell save DC or be knocked prone.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Keen Sight.</i></b> The great beast has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Pack Tactics.</i></b> The great beast has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the its allies is within 5 feet of the creature, and the ally isn’t incapacitated.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Large.</i></b> The great beast becomes a Large creature.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Powerful Build.</i></b> The great beast counts as one size larger when determining the weight it can push, drag, lift, or carry.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Savage Bite.</i></b> If the great beast hits a creature that is the same size, or smaller, with a bite attack, the creature is grappled (escape DC is equal to your shaman spell save DC). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the great beast cannot bite another target.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Standing Leap.</i></b> The great beast’s long jump is 15 feet, and its high jump is 10 feet, with or without a running start.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Sure Footed.</i></b> The great beast has advantage on saving throws to resist being forcibly moved or knocked prone.</p>
