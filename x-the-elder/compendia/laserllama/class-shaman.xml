        <description>
            <p>A female half-orc lumbered through the forest, her primal tattoos glistened in the light of the moon. A child of her tribe had seen a group of hobgoblins cutting lumber from their sacred grove of trees. Slicing her hand, the half-orc used her dark blood to inscribe a glyph on a the hilt of her greatclub. The weapon began to pulse with a deep green aura as she ventured forth to deal with the foolish hobgoblins that had dared profane the sacred grove of her tribe. The trespassers would pay with their lives for desecrating the sacred grove of the local spirits.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hunched over, elderly halfling griped his necklace as he faced down the massive ogre who had come to threaten his village. The necklace, made from the finger bones of the villiage's previous shamans, allowed their spirits to empower his aging body. Drawing upon this power, he could once again move with the vigor of his youth. Quick as lightning, he struck the ogre’s head with the quarterstaff that marked him as the elder of his people. As his foe's body slumped to the ground, the elderly halfling reflected on his time as champion. Soon it would come to an end, and his body would return to the earth. However, his spirit would live on, providing aid to the next shaman.</p>
            <p class="indent">In the dead of night, a thin elvish woman completed her sinister ritual, binding a spirit of pestilence to a lock of stolen hair. The following morning, far across the town, the man who had insulted the elvish woman the previous day came down with a sudden illness, and within hours he succumbed to the strange pox. The villagers suspected dark magic was at play, but after a few days they buried the fool and moved on.</p>
            <h4>CONDUITS OF SPIRITUAL ENERGY</h4>
            <p>Every living thing; plants, animals, and even the landscape, is suffused with spiritual power. Those who learn to draw out this latent primal energy, and even control sentient spirits, are known as Shamans. Once they open themselves to the spirit of the world around them, they can use their magic enhance their bodies, curse their foes, shape the landscape, channel the elements, and heal the sick. This spiritual power is ancient in origin, and since its discovery, its has been passed from one to the next in an unending chain of sages.</p>
            <h4>POWER OVERWHELMING</h4>
            <p>Through meditation and introspection shamans learn to tap into the spiritual power of creation innate to all living things. Once they open themselves, their connection to the spiritual world is intense. Each time they do so, they run a the risk of being overwhelmed by the wild spirits they wield. One wrong move, and novice and expert alike can consumed by the spiritual power they draw into themselves. But, for the few that strike a balance between themselves and this power, they are able to wield the primal magic that was instrumental in the creation of the multiverse and all things that live within.</p>
            <h4>CREATING YOUR SHAMAN</h4>
            <p>When creating your shaman, consider how you first learned to wield the power of spirits. Were you trained from birth to become the next champion of your tribe, destined to bear the power of your ancestors? Did a hag raise you in her ways, teaching you the secrets of hex magic? Or did you study under an ancient hermit, learning to draw upon the spiritual power within in all living things in order to heal the broken?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a shaman quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Wisdom your highest ability score followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the <i>guidance</i> and <i>shillelagh</i> cantrips, the spells entangle and heroism, and the Body Sacred Focus.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> You must have an Wisdom score of at least 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a shaman.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies Gained.</i></b> If shaman isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency in light armor, shields, simple weapons, and one skill from the shaman skill list when you take your first level in shaman.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting.</i></b> If you have a feature from another class that allows you to learn and cast spells, you can use your Primal Magic spell slots to cast the spells you gained through that feature, and you can use those spell slots to cast your shaman spells.</p>

			<description>
				<p>You have learned to draw upon your connection to primordial power of nature to cast spells. See chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this class description for the shaman spell list.</p>
				<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
				<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the shaman spell list at the end of this class description You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.</p>
				<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
				<p>The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of these spell slots. All of your spell slots are of the same level. To cast one of your shaman spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
				<p class="indent">For example, as a 5th level shaman, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
				<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
				<p>When you gain your Primal Magic at 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice from the shaman spell list.</p>
				<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Shaman table shows when you learn more shaman spells of your choice of 1st-level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new shaman spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level.</p>
				<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the shaman spells you know and replace it with another spell from the shaman spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
				<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
				<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
				<p>You can use a shamanistic fetish as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells. See the Shamanistic Fetishes note below for a list of objects that count as a shamanistic fetish.</p>
				<div class="sidebar">
					<h5 class="caption">Shamanistic Fetishes</h5>
					<p>When a shaman casts a spell, they must be careful not to be consumed by the power they draw upon. For this reason, their spellcasting focus, known as a shamanistic fetish, must be a mundane item of personal significance worth at least 1 gp.</p>
				</div>
				<!--<h5>SPELL VERSATILITY</h5>
				<p>At the end of a long rest, you can perform a short meditation, and replace one shaman spell you know from your Primal Magic feature with another spell from the shaman spell list of a level equal to, or lower then, your Slot Level.</p>-->
				<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
				<p>You can cast any shaman spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

Some shamans take this spiritual relationship a step further, allowing these incorporeal beings to work through their bodies, granting them increased physical and martial abilities. Known as Spirit Warriors, these warlike shamans are often found guarding sacred places, ancient holy sites, and places of great spiritual power. Woe to those who would rouse the ire of these spiritual guardians.</p>

			<p>Raised by wild beasts, feeling more at home with animals then their own kin, or developing a spiritual connection with a bestial spirit, the shamans known as Wild Hearts often live a double life. On one hand, they are humanoids with families and cultures of their own, on the other they battle an intense desire to dwell amongst the wild beasts of the world. Drawing upon their intense spiritual connection with bestial spirits of the land, Wild Hearts are able to assume the form of great and terrible animals, serving as guardians of all wildlife.</p>

				<p>Your connection with the spirits of the wild allows you to take on the shape of a Great Beast, the legendary guardian of all wild creatures. Beginning at 3rd level, you can expend one of your Primal Magic spell slots as bonus action on your turn to transform into a Great Beast. While transformed, you use the Great Beast stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the appearance of your Great Beast, but its appearance has no effect on its abilities. While you are transformed the following rules apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your Great Beast gains one Bestial Trait of your choice from the list at the end of this Spirituality.</li>
                    <li>You use the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the Great Beast, but you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies.</li>
                    <li>You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the Great Beast. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert because you dropped to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form.</li>
                    <li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your Great Best form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell.</li>
                    <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the Great Beast is capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses unless the Great Beast also has that sense.</li>
                    <li>Any equipment you are wearing or carrying merges into your Great Beast form. Equipment that merges with your Great Beast form has no effect while transformed.</li>
                </ul>
				<p class="indent">Your Great Beast form lasts for 1 hour. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another Primal Magic spell slot. You also revert to your normal form if you use a bonus action to do so, fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Savage Bite.</i></b> If the Great Beast hits a creature that is the same size, or smaller, with a bite attack, the creature is grappled (escape DC is equal to your shaman spell save DC).

                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Standing Leap.</i></b> The Great Beast’s long jump is 15 feet, and its high jump is 10 feet, with or without a running start.</p>
