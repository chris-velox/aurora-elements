            <p>While most ordinary people do their best to avoid danger and minimize risk, there are those that seek it out. Known as Daredevils, these are the rare few who relish the feeling of near-death experiences, and live for the heart-pounding excitement of defying death.</p>
            <p class="indent">Daredevils often go out of their way to put their lives on the line and will justify anything that sends adrenaline coursing through their veins. They would rather leap from rooftop to rooftop then walk the streets, swing from tree to tree then ride in a wagon. Due to their way of life Daredevils develop a knack for avoiding, what for most would be, certain death.</p>

            <p>The secret ways of druidic magic are closely guarded and only taught only those chosen to become the next generation druidic guardians. However, even the most well guarded secrets can be stolen. Those that have learned the practice of druidic magic outside of its ordained circles are named after most notorious thief of the animal kingdom, the Magpie.</p>
            <p class="indent">While most Magpies are known for acquiring their abilities through nefarious means; like tricking an Archfey or training under an exiled druid, some are selected by druidic circles to carry out specialized missions. How did you come to wield the ancient magic of the forest?</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Magpie Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Druid spell list. The Spells Known column of the Magpie Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Druid spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Druid spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Druid spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

            <p>While most gods have Clerics, Paladins, and priests sworn to their service, only the most ruthless gods employ those known as Justicars. These rare servants of the divine seek to impose the will of their god through any means necessary.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sometimes self-appointed, Justicars often operate from the shadows, working to snuff out heresy and dissent wherever it is present. Most temples condemn the work of these divine hunters, and some even flat-out deny that they exist. However, denial and condemnation do not cause a Justicar to waver. They are driven by a fanatical belief that their actions are justified, no matter the cost, and they are only beholden to the words directly from the mouth of their god.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Justicar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the spell wrathful smite and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast wrathful smite using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Paladin spell list. The Spells Known column of the Magpie Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Paladin spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Paladin spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Paladin spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells, since your power comes from your belief. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

            <p>At 9th level, your mastery of alchemical explosives allows you to alter your explosives in the following ways:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Appearance.</em></strong> You may alter the outward appearance of your explosives. When unlit, a creature must succeed on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) against your Explosive save DC to recognize them as explosives.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Damage Type.</em></strong> You may change the damage type of any explosive you craft to bludgeoning, piercing, fire, thunder, or lightning. This choice must be made when you craft your explosives at the end of a long rest.</p>
