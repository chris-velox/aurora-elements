            <p>While almost all wizards study in formal schools under the tutelage of a wise master, some wizards reject traditional arcane schooling and strike out into the world to learn by doing. These rare few who hone their craft out in the wilds are referred to as Hedge Wizards. Though their methods are frowned upon by formal wizarding schools, any archmage worthy of his station will reluctantly recognize that Hedge Wizards are the true masters of the low magics.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of their background, all Hedge Wizards reject the traditional methods of wizardry. When creating your Hedge Wizard consider how your spellcasting and spellbook may differ from a wizard who attended a formal school.</p>

For the purposes of this ability, a failed spell is a spell that imposes no effects and deals no damage to the environment, creatures, or objects when cast. If a creature uses a Legendary Resistance to avoid a spell's effect, it does not count as a failed spell.</p>

            <p>Wizards spend their lives memorizing esoteric formulas that allow them to produce wondrous arcane effects. However, when produced spontaneously, spells are extremely taxing on the caster. To preserve their power, most wizards learn to cast ritual spells, spells that take longer to produce, but aren't as draining on a wizard's magical stamina. Some wizards, known as Ritualists, dedicate their lives to mastering the deliberate and reliable magic of ritual spellcasting.</p>

                <p>Beginning at 6th level, when you cast an Arcanometal Spell, you can siphon off a small amount of energy to grant yourself temporary hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot you expended to cast the spell. While you have temporary hit points from this ability, you are resistant to all non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">Temporary hit points gained from this ability last until the end of your next long rest, or until you gain temporary hit points from another source.</p>
