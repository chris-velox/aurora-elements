        <description>
            <p>The pallid half-elf mutters an incantation under his breath, and his shadow comes alive, taking the form of a massive wolf. At his command the wolf pounces on his attacker, a foolish bandit, knocking him to the ground. The half-elf chants another incantation, and as pulsing green orbs of acidic energy forms in his hands as the bandit struggles in vain against the massive shadow-beast. The bandit lets out a piercing scream, filled with regret, as the two spheres of acidic energy fly towards him.</p>
            <p class="indent">As the grass and trees smolder from the great dragon’s fiery blast, the smoke clears to reveal a young man. His clothes burned away to reveal patches of golden scales. His eyes flash a fierce gold, and white jets of flame burst from his fingertips. The dragon reels from the impact, crashing into the dirt. He had underestimated this mortal, how had he come to wield power rivaling a dragon?</p>
            <p class="indent">The young halfling girl ducked into an alleyway, quickly hiding the stolen loaf of bread under her cloak. Back in the market she had come from, chaos had broken out. She had attempted a simple enchantment, just enough to convince the baker to give her a loaf of bread for free, but her magic had other plans. As she whispered to the baker, a crack - like a bolt of lightning - could be heard throughout the market, and suddenly all the produce in the square spoiled. She cursed this power that caused her parents to abandon her to the streets. If she could only control this power she could do much to ease the suffering of other urchins like herself.</p>
            <h4>UNEXPLAINED POWERS</h4>
            <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p>
            <h4>RAW MAGIC</h4>
            <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of powerful beings or elemental energies. Others carry a raw uncontrolled magic within them, chaotic storms that manifest in unexpected ways.</p>
            <p class="indent">The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some arcane bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a celestial, the blessing of a djinni at birth, or the taste of water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SORCERER</h4>
            <p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose a sorcerous origin from the options detailed in the class description, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Charisma your highest ability score followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and magic missile.</p>
            <h5>OPTIONAL RULE: MULTICLASSING</h5>
            <p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose the sorcerer as one of your classes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a 13 in Charisma to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are a sorcerer.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting.</i></b> If you have the Spellcasting class feature from another class, you can use the sorcery points you gain as a sorcerer to cast spells you know, or have prepared, from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast sorcerer spells.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

                <p>You have been infused with a spark arcane magic. Starting at 1st level, this innate spark fuels your spells. See chapter 10 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the general rules of Spellcasting, and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level.</p>
                <h5>SORCERY POINTS</h5>
                <p>The Sorcerer table shows how many sorcery points you have to cast your Spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend the amount of sorcery points indicated in the table below. You regain all expended sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, as a 3rd level sorcerer, you can cast the spell <i>burning hands</i> at 2nd-level by spending 3 sorcery points.</p>
                <h5 class="caption">SORCERY POINT COST</h5>
                <table>
                    <thead>

                </table>
                <h5>SPELL LIMIT</h5>
                <p>Your sorcerer level limits the potency of spells that you can cast. This is reflected in the Spell Limit column of the Sorcerer Table. For example, as a 5th-level sorcerer, you are limited to casting spells of 3rd-level or lower.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer Table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level equal to your Spell Limit or lower. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd-level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level equal to your Spell Limit or lower.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>Your body itself is your spellcasting focus, you do not need a spellcasting focus to cast spells. However, you must have one free hand in order to cast spells that require somatic or material components. If a spell has a material component with a gold cost, you must still supply it to cast the spell.</p>
                <h5>SPELL VERSATILITY</h5>
                <p>When you finish a long rest, you can choose one sorcerer spell you know and replace it with another sorcerer spell of a level equal to, or lower then, your Spell Limit.</p>

		<supports>Alternate Sorcerous Origin</supports>
		<description>
			<p>One day a light blazed forth within you—the illumination of psionic power. Your mind now simmers with this power, the full extent of which you won’t fully grasp for years to come. You can touch other minds with it and alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?</p>
			<p class="indent">Among githyanki and githzerai, the powers of Psionic Soul sorcerers are revered and marshaled on both sides of the gith war. In Eberron, many kalashtar dream of discovering this origin’s abilities within themselves, and in Athas, more sorcerers are born with a Psionic Soul than with any other source of power. In the glades of primeval woods touched by the Feywild, children sometimes awaken to the wonders of psionic power. And in communities that survive Far Realm incursions, some folk are mutated into horrific aberrations, while a lucky few not only remain themselves, but also discover that psionic energy now suffuses their minds.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a Psionic Soul sorcerer, you decide how you acquired your powers. Were you born with them, and did they manifest throughout childhood? Or did an extraordinary event later in life leave you shining with psionic awareness? Consult the Psionic Origins table for a possible origin of your power.</p>
