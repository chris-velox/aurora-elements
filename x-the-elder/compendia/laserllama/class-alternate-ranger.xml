        <description>
			<p>Rough and wild looking, a grizzled man silently moves through the forest, tracking the band of orc raiders that had moved into the peaceful farmland he protected. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he leaps out from the cover of the forest, preying on the orcs when they stop to rest. In a flash, he becomes a whirlwind of steel.</p>
			<p class="indent">After tumbling away from a blast of freezing air, a slender female elf finds her feet and draws her bow, letting loose another arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the great beast, she releases her final arrow. With a piercing roar the terrible monster plummets to the ground and lies motionless.</p>
			<p class="indent">Holding their hand high, a young dwarf whistles, and the hawk circling high above returns to the side of its master. Whispering instructions, the dwarf points to the owlbear they’ve been tracking. In a blur, the dwarf and their hawk move as one, and before the owlbear can react to the assault, it lies slain at the feet of the dwarven warrior.</p>
			<p class="indent">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
			<h4>DEADLY HUNTERS</h4>
			<p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in tracking and hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization; groups of raiders, rampaging beasts, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus on mastering devastating techniques and styles of combat. They often focus these martial abilities on one creature, aiming to slay their foe before they have a chance to retaliate.</p>
			<p class="indent">Thanks to their familiarity with the wild, rangers can harness the power of nature to cast minor spells and enhance their hunting skills. Their magic, like their combat ability, emphasizes speed, stealth, and the hunt.</p>
			<h4>WILD ADVENTURERS</h4>
			<p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, their true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, they may be the first, and possibly last, line of defense.</p>
			<p class="indent">Their fierce dedication makes rangers well suited to adventuring. Accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath, they make excellent guides for adventuring parties that have real experience with the wilds.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A RANGER</h4>
			<p>Consider the nature of your training. Did you train with a mentor, wandering the wilds together, or did you forge a magical connection to nature in your own way? No matter their background, most rangers choose to adventure to impart their knowledge of the wilds on to the next generation, securing the safety of civilization for years to come.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. If you wish to focus on ranged attacks or hunting, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the Outlander background.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you wish to focus more on skirmishing or fighting your foes head-on (like with dual-wielding), make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Mercenary background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You are a master marksman, striking from afar. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>BLIND FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You have honed your other senses to fight even when you cannot see. You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can see anything that isn’t behind total cover, even if you’re blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.</p>
                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>
                <p>Your training focused on defending yourself from your foes. While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <h5>DRUIDIC WARRIOR</h5>
                <p>Your connection to the spirits of nature is stronger then most other rangers. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>You have mastered the art of fighting with a single weapon. When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to weapon damage rolls.</p>
                <h5>MARINER</h5>
                <p>You have trained to fight on, around, and in the water. As long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to armor class.</p>
                <h5>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
                <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on hit. If you aren’t wielding any weapons or a shield, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, at the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</p>
                <h5>VERSATILE FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you make an attack with a versatile weapon, and you are wielding no other weapon or a shield, you can use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike or shove attack.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use this bonus action even if you are wielding your versatile weapon with two hands.</p>

            <description>
                <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the ranger spell list.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your ranger spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down. The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your intimate relationship with nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. See chapter 5, of the Player’s Handbook for a list of things that count as druidic foci.</p>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast a ranger spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

                <p>Upon adopting this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a primal beast as a companion. It is friendly to you and your allies and obeys your commands. You choose the form your primal beast takes, selecting an appropriate stat block: Beast of the Air, Beast of the Earth, or Beast of the Sea. The stat block uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Your beast bears primal markings, indicating its mystical origin.</p>
                <p class="indent">In combat, the primal beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.

            <p>Dragons are some of the most powerful creatures in the multiverse, and even the most well-read scholars are unsure of the full magical potential of ancient dragons. Sometimes, for reasons that may be mysterious, a powerful ancient dragon will call upon a ranger who has proved themselves worthy of draconic power. These rare few are granted the boon of a minor draconic companion, known as a drake.</p>
            <p class="indent">Known as Drake Wardens, form a mystical bond with their draconic companion that allows them to summon the drake to their side, and share in the awe inspiring power of dragons. Together with their drake, they venture forth, and as their bond deepens, both ranger and drake grow in draconic presence and mystical might.</p>

            <p>With their varied skills, rangers can take up many roles; guide, naturalist, tracker, or guardian, but at their core rangers are all hunters. Rangers that lean into their role as a deadly predator, honing their combat skills, are known as hunters. These warriors accept their place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. Walking this path, they master specialized techniques to better combat the threats they face. True hunters will face any foe; marauding gnolls, grotesque trolls, or terrible dragons</p>

            <p>Where there is power, there are those that abuse that power. Spellbreakers are a small, but dedicated, fraternity of rangers who specialize in hunting down spellcasters that use their arcane abilities to bring harm to others. While most pursue the life of a Spellbreaker for noble reasons, there are some who seek to destroy any who wield the weave. Most Spellbreakers operate in the shadows, only revealing themselves when the time is right and their success is a certainty. When one wrong move could end in disintegration, there is no room for error.</p>
