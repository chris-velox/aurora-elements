        <description>
            <p>A graying gnome was hunched over his workbench, carefully adjusting the clockwork mechanism that would power his creation. Before him laid an automaton of intricate iron gears within a shell of custom plate armor, built to resemble a large gnome. The pint-sized inventor affixed his signature, a mithril mustache, to the face plate. As he did, a jolt of electric- -blue arcane energy flashed from the automaton. With a sharp motion, the Finnblewright Mark II sat upright and awaited the first command of its creator.</p>
            <p class="indent">The small goblin delicately made his way down the tunnel that he had set with deadly traps. This was the third time this year his clan had moved to avoid being raided by adventuring parties, and the inventive goblin was determined to protect the newest cave that was their home. He was confident that this time his traps would stop the adventurers that always seemed to find their way to his home.</p>
            <p class="indent">A young human woman, wearing a worn leather apron over her fine clothes, flexed the steel gauntlet she had just finished enchanting. As she closed her fist the gauntlet let forth a blinding arc of lavender lightning, destroying the table on the opposite side of the room. As the dust settled, she affixed the gauntlet to her now complete suit of arcane armor. When she reveled this to her father, the latest in a long line of strange experiments, he would have no choice but to finally show her his approval.</p>
            <p class="indent">All of these characters described above are artificers, masters of imbuing arcane magic into wondrous inventions.</p>
            <h4>MASTERS OF INNOVATION</h4>
            <p>Relentless in their pursuit of innovation, every artificer is defined by an insatiable curiosity and willingness to push the limits of arcane invention, even at great personal risk to themselves. An artificer defines themselves by the fruits of their work, and they see mastering the basics of their chosen craft as the first step toward true greatness.</p>
            <p class="indent">Deep down, the goal of every artificer is the discovery of a new groundbreaking invention, magical or otherwise. Some artificers are engineers, students of science and warfare, who bring their considerable intellect to bear to construct deadly weapons augmented with magic. Others see themselves as arcane artists, combining the rigid arcane formulas of wizardry with the artisanal touch of their own tools.</p>
            <h4>FIERCE RIVALRIES</h4>
            <p>Almost every artificer has a least one rival, someone who they seek to outdo at every turn. These rivalries are the sole motivation of some artificers, and to them, outdoing their rival is more valuable then any fame or riches they could gain from their discoveries. Many are willing to risk everything to arrive the site of a new discovery before their rival.</p>
            <p class="indent">By the same token, artificers with similar philosophies and aims often band together in loose artisan’s guilds. They share insights and discoveries, hoping to keep ahead of rival guilds by pooling resources and working as a team. However, even when working together, most artificers are protective of any insights they think could lead to a groundbreaking discovery.</p>
            <h4>CREATING YOUR ARTIFICER</h4>
            <p>When creating an artificer, think about their background and drive for adventure. Who is their rival and what event started their feud? What is your artificer’s relationship with the artisan who taught them the basics of their craft? Are they part of a guild? What role do artificers play in the campaign world? Do artificer guilds exist in all the major cities, or are you the first person to pursue the path of arcane invention?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an artificer quickly by using these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the artisan background. Third, choose the Enhanced Defense and Repeating Shot Infusions.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">Multiclassing and the Artificer</h5>
                <p>If your group uses the rule on multiclassing in the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>, here’s what you need to know if you choose the artificer as one of your classes.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> As a multiclass character, you must have a 13 in Intelligence to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a artificer.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies Gained.</i></b> If artificer isn’t your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, shields, tinker’s tools, and one set of artisan’s tools of your choice.</p>
            </div>

                <p>You have learned to infuse objects with your signature brand of magic. At 1st level, you learn two Infusions of your choice from the list at the end of this class. As you gain levels in this class, you learn additional Infusions, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.</p>
                <p class="indent">At the end of a long rest, if you have access to your tinker’s tools, or a set of artisan’s tools that you are proficient with, you can replace one of your Infusions Known with another Infusion of your choice that you meet the prerequisites for.</p>
                <h5>INFUSING AN OBJECT</h5>
                <p>At the end of a long rest, you can use your tinker’s tools, or a set of artisan’s tools that you are proficient with, to touch a nonmagical object, imbuing it with one Infusion you know. If the Infusion requires attunement, you can attune the instant you infuse the item, or you can forgo attunement so another creature can attune to it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must follow the normal attunement process.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Infusion remains in an item indefinitely. If you die, the Infusion vanishes after a number of days have passed equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). Infusions vanish immediately if you give up your knowledge of one to learn another, or imbue the Infusion into another object.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of each long rest, up to one for each Infusion you know. You must touch each of the objects, and each Infusion can be in only one object at a time, but, no object can bear more than one Infusion at a time. If you transfer an Infusion to a new object, the previous instance of that Infusion immediately ends, and then the Infusion applies to the new object.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Using your signature tools and your own special brand of arcane magic, you can produce spell effects from strange and wondrous objects. See chapter 11 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the artificer spell list included with this class for your list of spells.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast a spell, you must expend a slot equal to the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell magic missile and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast magic missile using either spell slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the artificer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Artificer table shows when you learn more artificer spells of your choice. Each spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new artificer spell of either 1st or 2nd-level.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can choose one artificer spell you know and replace it with another spell from the artificer spell list that is of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for artificer spells, as your understanding of the theory behind magic to produce spells. You use Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability, and you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

                <p>Alchemy is a delicate art, tip the ratio of ingredients too far out of line and the effects could be disastrous. Those that study the magic of arcane potions and brews are known as Alchemists. They are experts at combining exotic reagents to produce a variety of materials and effects. From healing droughts that can mend a wound in moments, to sticky goo that explodes when it comes in contact with open flame. With careful preparation, and a bit of luck, Alchemists are masters of both giving life and leeching it away.</p>

                <h4>ALCHEMICAL ELIXIR INFUSIONS</h4>
                <p>At the end of each long rest, you can use your alchemist’s supplies to prepare one copy of each Elixir you know, without expending spell slots. These Elixirs are contained in Tiny glass vials, always produce the spell effects at their lowest level, and become inert at the end of your next long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, a creature can drink an Elixir, administer an Elixir to a willing creature, or throw an Elixir at a point within 30 feet. If thrown, the Elixir takes effect at the point of impact. If an Elixir produces an effect that requires concentration, the creature that consumes the Elixir must concentrate on the effect as if they were concentrating on a spell. Elixirs use your artificer spell save DC.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you chose the Create Minor Elixir infusion and selected cure wounds and grease, then at the end of each long rest you prepare one cure wounds Elixir, and one grease Elixir. You can then use these Elixirs at some point during the adventuring day without expending a spell slot.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, you can create an additional copy of an Elixir you know by expending the spell slot required in the Elixir’s infusion description. Elixirs can be used as part of the same action you expended the spell slot to create them.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>Beginning at 3rd-level, your alchemical experiments have yielded you a tiny homunculus servant. You determine the homunculus’ appearance, it is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Homunculus Servant stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In combat, the homunculus shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you use a bonus action to command it to take another action, or an action from its stat block. If you are incapacitated, the homunculus can take any action of its choice. If you die, the homunculus turns to ash.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If it has died within the last hour, you can use an action to revive it by touching it and expending a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. It returns to life with its maximum hit points.</p>
                    <p class="indent">At the end of a long rest, you can create a new homunculus by using your alchemist’s supplies. If you already have a homunculus from this feature, the first one turns to ash.</p>

                <p>Of all the specialties that an artificer can pursue, that of the armorer is the most defensively minded. Focused on becoming a bastion of metal and magic, armorers modify a set of armor to function as a second skin. They focus the magic of their artifice through their armor to unleash potent attacks and generate a formidable defense. Armorers view their armor as an extension of their very selves. Inventor and armor become one, as they refine its magical capabilities.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>By 3rd-level, your tinkering has borne you a faithful construct, a steel defender. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in multiple places.</p>
                    <p class="indent">In combat, your steel defender shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on it’s own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take the action in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide or Search action. If you are incapacitated, the steel defender takes an action of its choice.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the steel defender has died within the last hour, as an action, you can touch it with your smith’s tools and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher to revive it. The steel defender returns to life with its maximum hit points.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you finish a long rest, you can create a new steel defender with your smith’s tools. If you already have a steel defender from this feature, the first one perishes.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Upon creation, choose the shape of your steel defender from the options below. Its shape determines its abilities.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Humanoid.</b> Your steel defender resembles a medium humanoid creature of your choice, but is clearly a construct. It has opposable fingers and is proficient with shields. It can use its digits to perform basic tasks, and it can equip or wear any items that are appropriate for its anatomy.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Quadruped.</b> Your steel defender resembles large beast of your choice, but is clearly a construct. Its movement speed increases by 10 feet, and it is trained to be ridden as a mount, but only by you. When being used as a mount, the steel defender retains its place in initiative order, but can use its movement speed as part of your turn.</p>
