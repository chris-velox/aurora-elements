        <description>
            <p>A young human guard quietly slipped past his comrades out the back door of the armory where the townsfolk were hiding. A gang of bandits had come upon the village suddenly that morning, and their captain had issued a challenge. If a warrior from the town could best him in single combat, his gang of bandits would leave peacefully. Though the young man had only joined the town guard one season ago, he could already best every other guardsman with the sword. Much to the surprise of the townsfolk, he drew his sword, muttered a prayer, and stepped forward to defend his home.</p>
            <p class="indent">A graying female dwarf surveyed the enemy camp as the sun began to set. Along with three of her most loyal soldiers, she had come to the edge of the enemy encampment with the intent to rout the army or die in the process. In a fully pitched battle, the small band of dwarves she commanded would stand no chance against this great host. However, if her small group of elite soldiers followed her orders to the letter, they had a chance to cut the head off the army before it came to all out battle. For what could be her final mission, she gripped the haft of her battleaxe and gave the order to move out.</p>
            <p class="indent">The flamboyant half-elven gladiator paused for a moment, basking in the roar of the crowd. He remembered his first gladiatorial match in a dirty and cramped arena, surrounded by drunken pirates and slavers. Now he performed for the king and queen amidst the bustle of the largest city in the kingdom. The time to savor this moment was over, and in a flash, he wheeled around and plunged his gilded spear into the heart of his opponent, ending what would be the final fight of his gladiatorial career and earning his freedom.</p>
            <h4>MASTERS OF THE BATTLEFIELD</h4>
            <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Even veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are not considered true fighters. Born with an innate talent with weaponry, and a keen battle instinct, true fighters cannot resist the call of battle and adventure.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter. Something deep within them compels them to seek out conflict and throw themselves into the midst of it. Often champions of fair play, competition, and feats of physical might, fighters make for loyal friends and deadly foes.</p>
            <h4>THE ARMAMENTS OF WAR</h4>
            <p>Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, cut down a foe with a longsword, and use a bow with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Fighters wield their weapons and armor of choice as an extension of their very self, becoming beautiful yet deadly whirls of sharpened steel on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though every fighter can wield all types of weapons with ease, their similarities end there. Some choose to pursue immense physical might, crushing those that stand against them with heavy blows. Some prefer to strike from afar, slaying foe with deadly bow and arrow. Others use their knowledge of battle to coordinate their allies. Others still choose to augment their martial abilities with arcane spells. No matter their style, every fighter is deadly in their own way.</p>
            <h4>CREATING YOUR FIGHTER</h4>
            <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a fighter by following these suggestions. First, make your Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on the weapons you wish to use, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
            <h5>OPTIONAL RULE: MULTICLASSING</h5>
            <p>If you use the multiclassing rule from the <i>Player's Handbook</i>, here's what you need to know if you take a level in fighter.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> You must have at least a 13 in either Strength or Dexterity to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a fighter.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> If fighter isn't your initial class, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, shields, all simple weapons, and all martial weapons.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>
                <p>At 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting that best represents your training with the armaments of war. You gain a Fighting Style of your choice from the options listed below.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 6th level, you gain an additional Fighting Style of your choice. You cannot select the same Fighting Style twice.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You are a master marksman, striking from afar. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>BLIND FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You have trained to fight even when you cannot see. You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. You can see an invisible creature within that range, unless it successfully hides from you.</p>
                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>
                <p>You have honed your defensive abilities. While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to weapon damage rolls.</p>
                <h5>FINESSE FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You have trained in the classical art of light swordplay. When wielding a finesse weapon in one hand, and nothing in your other hand, you gain a +2 bonus to both your attack rolls, and a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.</p>
                <h5>GRAPPLER</h5>
                <p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can attempt to grapple them as a bonus action. You must have a free hand to initiate the grapple.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, you can drag a grappled creature up to your full movement speed if they are your size or smaller.</p>
                <h5>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
                <h5>IMPROVISED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You are a master of fighting dirty and underhanded. You gain proficiency with improvised weapons. Once per turn, when you make an attack using a non-magical improvised weapon, you can choose to roll the damage die twice and take the higher damage roll. When you do this the improvised weapon is destroyed and rendered useless for any further attacks.</p>
                <h5>INTERCEPTION</h5>
                <p>As a reaction, when a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus. You must be wielding a shield, a simple weapon, or a martial weapon in order to use this reaction.</p>
                <h5>PROTECTION</h5>
                <p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can impose disadvantage on the attack roll as a reaction. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
                <h5>MARINER</h5>
                <p>You have trained to fight on, around, and in the water. As long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed equal to your movement speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.</p>
                <h5>SUPERIOR TECHNIQUE</h5>
                <p>You learn one maneuver of your choice from the list at the end of this class. If the maneuver requires the target to make a saving throw, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
                <p class="indent">You also gain one superiority die, which is a d6. To use one of your maneuver you must expend this die. You regain your expended superiority die when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain the Combat Superiority feature at 2nd level, the maneuver and superiority die you gained don't count against your number of Maneuvers Known or Superiority Dice, and this superiority die scales with your other dice.</p>
                <h5>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. When you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                <h5>TWO WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you take the Attack action while engaging in two-weapon fighting, you can make one additional attack with your off-hand weapon, in place of the normal bonus action attack, adding your ability modifier to the damage.</p>
                <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you aren't wielding a weapon or shield when you make the attack, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, at the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.</p>
                <h5>VERSATILE FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When wielding a versatile weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls when wielding it one-handed, and a +1 bonus to damage rolls when wielding it two-handed.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, as a bonus action you can use your free hand to make an unarmed strike, shove attack, or don or doff a shield.</p>

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</b> You know two 1st-level spells from the arcane knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Arcane Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher. Your spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known another spell from the arcane knight spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arcane knight spells, since you commit the few potent spells you know to memory. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast or make an attack roll with.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

            <p>Fighters who walk the path of the Divine Knight seek to enhance their martial skill with divine magic. Compared to other divine spellcasters, these elite divine warriors know few spells. However, what they lack in divine gifts they make up for with their deadly skill with the armaments of war. Divine Knights all have the same goal; combine devotion to their god and martial skills into a deadly force.</p>

                <p>When you adopt this archetype at 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast divine spells.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Cantrips.</b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the divine knight spell list. You learn an additional cantrip of your choice from the divine knight spell list at 10th level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b> The Divine Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</b> You know two 1st-level spells from the divine knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Divine Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher. Your spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known another spell from the divine knight spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your arcane knight spells, since you commit the few potent spells you know to memory. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast or make an attack roll with.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

            <p>Not all fighters rely solely on themselves in battle, some use their knowledge of battlefield tactics to coordinate their allies. Commanders are those who lead the men from the front, issuing orders and inspiring greatness in others by their own brave deeds. While skilled in their own right, a true Commander leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</p>

            <p>Guardians are elite fighters whose true strength shows when defending or fighting side by side with an ally. Skilled with weapons of all types, they are especially deadly with a protective style of fighting that utilizes a weapon and shield. They coordinate their tactics with their allies, becoming a deadly unit on the battlefield. When alone, Guardians are a minor threat, but when standing beside powerful allies they become impenetrable walls of flesh and steel. If a Guardian blocks your path, it is best to find another way around.</p>
