        <description>
            <p>The young guard quietly slipped past his comrades out the back door of the armory where the townsfolk were hiding. A bandit gang had come upon the town suddenly that morning, and their captain had issued a challenge. If a warrior from the town could best him in single combat, his gang of bandits would leave peacefully. Even though the young man had only joined the town guard one season ago, he could already best every other guard with the sword. To the surprise of the townsfolk, he drew his sword, muttered a prayer, and stepped forward to defend his home.</p>
            <p class="indent">A graying dwarf surveyed the enemy camp as the sun began to set. Along with three of her best soldiers, she had come to the edge of the enemy camp with the intent to rout the army or die in the attempt. In a fully pitched battle, the small band of dwarves she commanded wouldn’t stand a chance against this great host. However, if her group of elite soldiers followed her orders to the letter, they had a chance to cut off the head of the army before it came to all out battle. For what could be her final mission, she gripped the haft of her battleaxe and gave the order to move out.</p>
            <p class="indent">The flamboyant elven gladiator paused for a moment, basking in the roar of the crowd. He remembered his first gladiatorial match in the underground arena, surrounded by drunken pirates and slavers. Now he performed for the king and queen amidst the bustle of the largest city in the kingdom. The time to savor this moment was over, and in a flash, he wheeled around and plunged his gilded spear into the heart of his opponent, ending what would be the final fight of his gladiatorial career and earning his freedom.</p>
            <h4>MASTERS OF THE BATTLEFIELD</h4>
            <p>Not every city guard, militia member, or professional soldier is considered to be a true fighter. Born with an innate talent with the armaments of war, and a keen battle instinct, a true fighter cannot resist the call of battle and adventure. Often coming from the ranks of elite officers, trained bodyguards, veteran mercenaries, and dedicated knights, true fighters are known for their masterful training and skill in battle.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter. Something deep within them compels them to seek out conflict and throw themselves into the midst of it. Often champions of fair competition, and feats of physical might, fighters make for loyal companions and deadly foes.</p>
            <h4>THE ARMAMENTS OF WAR</h4>
            <p>Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, cut down a foe with a longsword, and use a bow with a high degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Fighters wield their weapons and armor of choice as an extension of their very self, transforming into beautiful yet deadly whirls of sharpened steel on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">While they all have skill in battle, the nature of a fighter’s training can greatly vary. Some cultivate immense physical might, crushing their foes with overwhelming blows. Some prefer to strike from afar, slaying their enemies before they are aware of their presence. Others use their knowledge of tactics to coordinate their allies. A rare few augment their martial abilities with limited, but potent, arcane spells.</p>
            <h4>CREATING YOUR FIGHTER</h4>
            <p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what sets you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a fighter quickly by using these suggestions. First, make your Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on the weapons you wish to use, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">Multiclassing and the Fighter</h5>
                <p>If your group uses the optional multiclassing rule, here’s what you need to know if you choose to take a level in the fighter class.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> As a multiclass character, you must have at least a Strength (or Dexterity) score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a fighter.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies.</i></b> If fighter isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a fighter: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons and martial weapons.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, your training sets you apart from other warriors. This skill is represented by Marital Exploits that you can use in combination with your attacks, ability checks, and saving throws. They are fueled by a pool of special Exploit Dice.</p>
                <h5>EXPLOIT DICE</h5>
                <p>The Fighter table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform your Martial Exploits. To use an Exploit, you must expend one of these Dice. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw and you regain all expended Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your Exploit Dice begin as d4s, and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Fighter table.</p>
                <h5>EXPLOITS KNOWN</h5>
                <p>You know two Exploits of your choice from the list at the end of this class description. The Exploits Known column of the Fighter table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. When you gain a level, you can choose one Exploit you know and replace it with another Exploit of your choice.</p>
                <h5>SAVING THROWS</h5>
                <p>If an Exploit requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p style="text-align: right;"><b>Exploit save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).</p>
                <h4>MARTIAL EXPLOITS</h4>
                <p>Listed below are the Martial Exploits available to the fighter. Each time you gain a level in this class, you can replace one Exploit you know with another Exploit of your choice.</p>

                <p>Arcane Knights are fighters who supplement their skill with the armaments of war with arcane knowledge. Compared to other mages who study only magic, Arcane Knights can only produce minor spells. However, when combined with their skill in the weapons of warfare, these minor magical spells become deadly enhancements. Proficient in both the arcane arts and the art of war, these spellswords are a deadly force.</p>
                <h4>ARCANE KNIGHT EXPLOITS</h4>
                <p>The Exploits below are exclusive to fighters of the Arcane Knight Archetype. They use Exploits to enhance their attacks with magic and defend themselves from arcane assaults.</p>

If your Arcane Knight uses divine magic or druidic magic, consider using Wisdom, instead of Intelligence, as a Spellcasting Ability, and replace the Arcane Knight spell list with either the cleric spell list or the druid spell list.</p>

                    <p>When you adopt the Arcane Knight Archetype at 3rd level, you learn to cast minor arcane spells, much like a wizard.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Cantrips. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Arcane Knight spell list. You learn one additional Arcane Knight cantrip when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Spell Slots. The Arcane Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher. You know two 1st-level spells from the Arcane Knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Arcane Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher. Your spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Arcane Knight spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Arcane Knight spells, as you commit the few potent spells you know to memory. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for an Arcane Knight spell.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

                    <p>At 3rd level, you can ritualistically bond yourself to a weapon of your choice. You perform the ritual over 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest and you must touch the weapon for the duration. At the conclusion you forge the bond.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You cannot be disarmed of your bonded weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can use a bonus action to summon it, instantly teleporting it to your hand. In addition, your bonded weapon can be used as a spellcasting focus for any Arcane Knight spells you known.</p>

                <p>Divine Knights are fighters who supplement their skill with the armaments of war with divine gifts. Compared to other divine spellcasters who have a closer divine connection, Divine Knights can only produce minor spells. However, when combined with their skill in the weapons of warfare, these minor divine spells become deadly enhancements. Proficient in both the divine gifts and the art of war, these holy warriors are a deadly force.</p>

                    <p>When you adopt the Divine Knight Archetype at 3rd level, you learn to cast minor divine spells, much like a cleric.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Divine Knight spell list. You learn one additional Divine Knight cantrip when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Divine Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</i></b> You know two 1st-level spells from the Divine Knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Divine Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher. Your spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Divine Knight spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Divine Knight spells, as you commit the few divine spells you know to memory. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a Divine Knight spell.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

            <description>
                <p>Weald Knights are fighters who supplement their skill with the armaments of war with natural magic. Compared to druids who only study the magic of nature, Weald Knights can only produce minor spells. However, when combined with their skill in the weapons of warfare, these minor natural spells become deadly enhancements. Proficient in both the druidic arts and the art of war, these wardens of nature are a deadly force.</p>
                <h4>ARCANE KNIGHT EXPLOITS</h4>
                <p>The Exploits below are exclusive to fighters of the Weald Knight Archetype. They use Exploits to enhance their attacks with magic and defend themselves from arcane assaults.</p>

                    <p>When you adopt the Weald Knight Archetype at 3rd level, you learn to cast minor nature spells, much like a druid.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Weald Knight spell list. You learn one additional Weald Knight cantrip when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Weald Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</i></b> You know two 1st-level spells from the Weald Knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Weald Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher. Your spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Weald Knight spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Weald Knight spells, as you commit the few potent spells you know to memory. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a Weald Knight spell.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

                <description>
                    <p>At 3rd level, you can ritualistically bond yourself to a weapon of your choice. The weapon must contain wood or leather. You perform the ritual over 1 hour, which can be during a short or long rest and you must touch the weapon for the duration. At the conclusion you forge the bond.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You cannot be disarmed of your bonded weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can use a bonus action to summon it, instantly teleporting it to your hand. In addition, your bonded weapon can be used as a spellcasting focus for any Weald Knight spells you known.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can have up to two bonded weapons at any one time, though, they must be summoned one at a time. If you bond a third weapon, you break the bond with one of the other two.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Minstrel Knights are fighters who supplement their skill with the armaments of war with the magic of entertainment, song and story telling. Compared to bards who only study the magic of music and song, Minstrel Knights can only produce minor spells. However, when combined with their skill in the weapons of warfare, these minor natural spells become deadly enhancements. Proficient in both the bardic arts and the art of war, these bladesingers are a deadly force.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>When you adopt the Minstrel Knight Archetype at 3rd level, you learn to cast minor nature spells, much like a druid.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Minstrel Knight spell list. You learn one additional Minstrel Knight cantrip when you reach 10th level in this class.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Minstrel Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</i></b> You know two 1st-level spells from the Minstrel Knight spell list. The Spells Known column of the Minstrel Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st-level or higher. Your spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you gain a level, you can replace one of your Spells Known with another spell from the Minstrel Knight spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Minstrel Knight spells, as you commit the few potent spells you know to memory. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC or making a spell attack roll for a Minstrel Knight spell.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
