            <p>You have been touched by primordial fire. Did you receive this power as a gift from a noble Efreeti, or were you born near a rift leading to the elemental plane of fire? This ember of primal flame within you may manifest in your outward appearance or through your emotions. Most Emberheart sorcerers revel in their exotic appearance; flame red hair, eyes like glowing embers, or dark skin with magma peering through cracks. Is your flaming soul a raging inferno, unable to be controlled, or, do you seek to master your power?</p>

                <description>You can grant an aegis of protective earth magic to one creature you touch, including possibly yourself. The creature gains resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. When a creature hits the protected target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the attacker and make one melee weapon attack against them. You can teleport in this way only if you and the attacker are on the same surface. If you use this ability to grant a protective aegis to another creature, the effect immediately ends for the first creature.</description>

            <p>Once a generation a true ruler is born among the people. Not necessarily of royal blood, these mortals have been marked by the gods for a great destiny. Some people seek out these rulers, trusting in divine judgment to select their ruler. However, to those currently in power, these sorcerers pose a great threat and are often secretly, and sometimes openly, persecuted by the powers that be.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a Divine Right sorcerer, you are destined to rule over your kin. You have been granted great power, but with that power comes responsibility. Will you use your abilities to lead the your people to destruction or into a new golden age?</p>

The following options are available to a sorcerer, in addition to those offered in the Player’s Handbook: The Genasi Bloodlines: Emberheart, Stoneblood, Stormsoul, and Waveborn, and the bloodline of Dwarven royalty, the Runebrand.</p>
            <h4>RUNEBRAND</h4>
            <p>Once a generation the heads of the seven dwarven clans gather to select a new king. This process is lengthy and often takes years to reach a decision, but when the new king is selected he undergoes a secret ceremony, imbuing his soul with the divine blessing of rulership.</p>

Maybe you were born somewhere tainted by the Far Realm, a planar blot that changed you forever.

                <h5 class="caption">PSIONICS &amp; SORCERY</h5>
                <p>Psionics hold a unique spot in Dungeons &amp; Dragons and is a critical part of one of the most iconic monsters; the Illithid. However, there has never been a satifying option for playing a fully-fledged psionic character in 5th edition.</p>
                <p class="indent">With some adjustments, I believe the sorcerer class is the best way to bring this type of player character to life. To have the flavor fully match the mechanics of a psionic character, talk to your Dungeon Master about using the following optional rules (or use my Alternate Sorcerer).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Intelligence Spellcasting:</b><br/>Change your saving throw proficiency, Spellcasting ability, Multiclassing prerequisites, and any other mentions of Charisma in the Sorcerer class description with Intelligence.</li>
                    <li><b>Psionic Origin Spells:</b><br/>One of the main drawbacks of the sorcerer is the small amount of spells known. Adding a list of Origin Spells, flavorful &amp;thematic spells that you automatically learn at certain levels, can go a long way to enhancing your psionic character.</li>
                    <li><b>Psionic Sorcery:</b><br/>At 6th level, you gain the optional feature, Psionic Sorcery which lets you cast spells without V,S,M components.</li>
                    <li><b>Spell Point Casting Variant:</b><br/>Use the Variant: Spell Points rule from page 288 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Spell points allow for more flexibility for the caster, and better simulate psionic mental resources. Just make sure to limit the number of spells of 6th-level and higher you can cast per day.</li>

            <p>You propel a lance of psionic disruption into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can use its action only to Dash or Disengage on its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and this spell doesn’t limit its action options.</p>
