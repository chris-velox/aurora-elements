			<p>Gods of the Astral Plane are as lost to time and space as the realm they reign over. The Astral Plane fills the gaps between the planes of existence and is an important, balancing force in the cosmic ecosystem of the multiverse. Practitioners of this domain see the absence of anything as something, and consider the Astral Plane as the ultimate destination of all things. These acolytes follow the ultimate path to their destination, and help shepherd others along their way in a grand mission of entropy. Clerics of the astral domain are chaotic by nature, but typically choose to destroy evil where they find it and hasten its inevitable journey to the Astral Plane.</p>

				<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create a brief tear in the planar fabric that leads to the Astral Plane. As a bonus action, you can point your finger at a point you can see within 60 feet to create a planar tear. The tear is minuscule, but creates a powerful vacuum that forces each creature within 15 feet of the point to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes force damage equal to 2d10 + half your cleric level and is pulled up to 15 feet toward the point. On a succesful save, a creature takes half as much force damage and is not pulled. The tear vanishes immediately after drawing in any nearby creatures.</p>
