            <p>The crack of lightning and boom of thunder herald the Relentless Storm, a being of immense power and strength that invokes storms wherever they tread. With them as your patron, you can channel this raw, powerful energy to demolish your foes, as well as the structures they hide behind, with the strength of the storm, leaving nothing but rubble in your wake.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 1st level, you can call down a bolt of lightning to both empower you and strike back your foes. As a bonus action on your turn, you choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you, which begins to spark with energy. At the start of your next turn, a blast of lightning strikes down, causing a 10-foot radius sphere to erupt centred on the point. Hostile creatures inside the sphere must make a Strength saving throw against your warlock spell save DC, being pushed 10 feet directly away from the centre of the sphere on a failed save. Additionally, hostile creatures that are inside the sphere when the lightning strikes can't take reactions until the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you're inside the sphere when the lightning strikes, your patron's strength shields you. You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your Charisma modifier + half your warlock level. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.</p>
                <p class="indent">The radius of the sphere increases as you gain levels in this class; becoming a 15-foot radius sphere at 5th level, and a 20-foot radius sphere at 9th level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

                <p class="flavor">Prerequisite: The Relentless Storm patron, Pact of the Chain feature</p>
                <p class="indent">When you summon your familiar, you can have it appear as a wind spirit. Your familiar has the statistics of a blood hawk (found on page 319 of the Monster Manual) except it is an elemental, rather than a celestial, fey, or fiend.</p>
                <p class="indent">While the spirit is perched on your shoulder, your movement speed increases by 10 feet and you gain a bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score and to Wisdom (Perception) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the spirit canâ€™t be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it canâ€™t take damage; and it is incapacitated.</p>
