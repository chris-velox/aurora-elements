                <p>Starting at 3rd level, you're able to empower others for battle, enhancing their skills and granting them strength. You can plant a banner in the ground within 5 feet of you as an action on your turn. The banner is incorporeal, can't be destroyed, and lasts for 1 minute. Once per turn whenever a friendly creature within 10 feet of the banner hits a creature with an attack or damages it with a spell, it can choose one creature damaged by that attack or spell and deal an additional 1d4 damage to it. This additional damage is your relevant damage type.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you place this banner, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">The additional damage increases as you gain levels in this class, increasing to 1d6 at 7th level, 1d8 at 10th level, 1d10 at 15th level, and 1d12 at 18th level.</p>
