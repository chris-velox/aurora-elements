            <p>Some dragons wage war, and others hoard treasure. Few, however, learn to cultivate and nurture the earth, becoming one with it. Dragon knights of the Garden Practice live simple lives with their dragons, and only heed the call of adventure if something precious to them is at stake.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, the draconic nature of your companion shifts to better reflect nature. Your dragon gains proficiency in the Nature skill, and your dragon also no longer needs to eat or drink. Instead, it gains sustenance for staying on the ground for at least 4 hours a day. Finally, you and your dragon can cast <i>druidcraft</i>.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your dragon also physically shifts to reflect this change, and its scales change colour to look like vibrant leaves, with flowers that bloom throughout.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, your dragon’s plant like nature allows it to attune to the seasons, granting the two of you benefits through the bond you share. When you finish a long rest, you choose one of the following seasons: Summer, Autumn, Winter, or Spring. Each season grants you benefits detailed in later features.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain access to the seasonal spells appropriate to the season you’re attuned to. You can cast one of the seasonal spells you have access to once, and regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. You gain a second use of this feature at 5th level, a third use at 11th level. Casting a spell 3rd or 4th level seasonal spell expends two uses of this feature.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach certain Dragon Knight levels, you gain new seasonal spells, as shown in each of the spell tables.</p>
                <p class="indent">Finally, you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a seasonal spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
