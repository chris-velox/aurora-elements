        <description>
            <p>Flicking her wrist and watching her tattoos turns a bright blue, the tiefling turns to look at her assailant. A man dressed in dark leathers with a cowl over his head watches her as he slowly pulls a knife from his belt. The tiefling scowls as ice begins to cover her skin, and then makes a motion with her hands as ice begins to rain down from above. The man ducks to the side, narrowly avoiding the ice, and lunges towards the woman, but his knife doesn’t managed to slip through the armour of ice that now shields her. She laughs and her tattoos glow again, now a bright yellow. She makes a motion to back hand him and there’s a spark of lightning and a clap of thunder as he’s thrown down the alley. He groans and goes to find his dagger, but the woman places her boot on his chest, her tattoos now a fiery red. The man begins to scream, but his tongue turns to ash fire swirls around the tiefling, scorching the man and the alley.</p>
            <p class="indent">This woman is a conduit, a person artificially infused with and fuelled by magic. While similar to sorcerers, a conduit isn’t skilled enough to hone their magic into spell slots, and instead unleashes their arcane firepower in destructive bursts.</p>
            <h4>MADE ARCANE</h4>
            <p>All conduits were once non-magical people. They had next to no natural ability with magic, and even if they could pull off a cantrip, they were unable to grasp the concepts and theory required to learn magic like a wizard would. Instead, these people were infused with magic, which now flows through their veins, sustaining them and allowing them to unleash destruction on their foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Either by rituals, experimentation, or planar forces, the bodies of conduits have been twisted and re-defined by the magic they now wield. Some conduits are created during wars, so that armies have arcane firepower that can be counted on to burn itself out before managing to flee. Others are accidents gone wrong, and might be caught in a dangerous spell, and have the magic flood their being.</p>
            <h4>ELEMENTAL CHAOS</h4>
            <p>Conduits are able to manipulate prime elemental forces. With destructive control over fire, ice, and lightning, they can tear apart their opposition. Each of these elements manifest in the same way among all conduits, but some favour one element over another, and other conduits might refuse to use a certain element all together.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A CONDUIT</h4>
            <p>The first thing you should consider when creating your conduit character is how you acquired your magic. Were you branded with powerful runes, did you fall into a devastating arcane trap, or even fall victim to the magic of creatures from the outer planes?</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of how you got your magic, you should also consider how it manifests. Does your character have tattoos on their body that glow when they use their magic, or does the air around them shimmer with energy as they use their surges?</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, consider how your character feels about their new power. Do they relish in it, and enjoy the power that now courses through their body, or do they fear it, and struggle to control their magic when their emotions get the better of them?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a conduit quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Intelligence, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an conduit, you gain the following class features.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 1st level, you can begin to manipulate the very fabric of magic, allowing you access to magical powers and abilities which you can spend potential energy to use and enhance: surges and focuses. Surges are raw power in arcane form, which can devastate the battlefield. Focuses shape your surges and allow you to hone your abilities.</p>
                <h5>POTENTIAL ENERGY</h5>
                <p>You have an amount of potential energy equal to your Intelligence modifier + your conduit level (rounded up). You regain all your spent potential energy when you finish a long rest, and half your total amount of potential energy when you finish a short rest.</p>
                <h5>SURGES</h5>
                <p>You know two surges when you first gain this feature, which are detailed below. You learn an additional surge at 5th level, and one more at 11th level.</p>
                <h5>FOCUSES</h5>
                <p>You know two focuses when you first gain this feature, which are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain conduit levels, you gain additional focuses of your choice, as shown in the Focuses Known column of the Conduit table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the focuses you know and replace it with another focus.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you use a surge on your turn, you can choose a single focus, spending an amount of potential energy specified by it, to add an additional affect to that surge. Whenever you use a focus on the Arcane Bolt surge, the potential you have to spend to use that focus is reduced by 1 (this doesn’t effect potential spent to overcharge a focus).</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you use a focus, you can’t use that focus again until the start of your next turn.</p>
                <h5>OVERCHARGE</h5>
                <p>Some surges and focuses can be overcharged, allowing you to spend additional potential to enhance their effects. You can spend any number of potential on an overcharge, up to a maximum number equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) on any overcharge.</p>
                <h5>ATTACK ROLLS AND SAVING THROWS</h5>
                <p>Some of your surges and focuses require you to make an attack roll, or require the target to make a saving throw to resist the talent’s effects. Your attack modifier and the saving throw DC are calculated as follows:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Arsenal Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Arsenal attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            </description>
            <sheet>
                <description>Arsenal Save DC: {{arsenal:save-dc}}. Arsenal Attach Bonus: +{{arsenal:attack-bonus}}.
                You have {{arcane-arsenal:potential-energy}} potential energy. You regain all your spent potential energy when you finish a long rest, and half your total amount of potential energy when you finish a short rest.
                Whenever you use a surge on your turn, you can choose a single focus, spending an amount of potential energy specified by it, to add an additional affect to that surge.
                You can spend up to {{arsenal:overcharge-limit}} potential energy to overcharge surges and focuses.</description>

                <h5>ARCANE BOLT</h5>
                <p>As an action, you can hurl a blast of energy at a creature you can see within 120 feet of you, making an attack roll against them. On a hit, that creature takes 2d8 force damage.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Overcharge.</b> You can spend 2 additional potential to have the bolt ignore half and three-quarters cover.</p>

                <p class="indent"><b>Overcharge.</b> Each additional 1 point you spend increases the radius of the sphere by 5 feet.</p>
                <h5>ARCANE PULSE</h5>
                <p>As an action, you can have each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from you make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d4 force damage on a failed save.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Overcharge.</b> Each additional 1 point you spend increases the length, width, and height of the cube by 10 feet.</p>
