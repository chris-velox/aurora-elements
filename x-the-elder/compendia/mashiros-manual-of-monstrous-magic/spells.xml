        <description>
            <p>You imbue a nonmagical suit of plate armor with magic, turning it into an animated armor for the spell’s duration. Once the spell ends, or if the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, it reverts back to a nonmagical suit of plate armor.</p>
            <p class="indent">The armor is under your control, and understands and obeys your spoken commands. Roll initiative for the armor, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the armor, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">The DM has the armor’s statistics.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until the armor is reduced to 0 hit points. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.</p>

            <p>Choose a severed hand within range. The hand must be from a murderer, and must have been severed no more than 24 hours ago. The target is animated into a crawling claw (the DM has the creature’s game statistics).</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command the claw if it is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the claw will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the claw only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the claw continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You touch a living creature and implant it with a blister of parasitic burgeoning life. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and a blister swells on its body. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while under the effect of this spell, the blister bursts, spilling forth a twig blight.</p>
            <p class="indent">The twig blight is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the blight, which has its own turn. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">The blight is under your control for 24 hours or until you cast this spell again, after which it stops obeying any command you’ve given it.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd. Additionally, when you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you can choose to create more blights, or stronger blights: two twig blights or one needle blight with a 4th-level slot, four twig blights, two needle blights, or one vine blight with a 6th-level slot, or eight twig blights, four needle blights, or two vine blights with a 8th-level slot.</p>

            <p>You can cast this spell only while standing in bright light. Choose a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid that had a non-evil alignment in life within range. Your spell extracts a dark figure from the corpse, raising it as a shadow (the DM has the creature’s game statistics).</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional shadows for each slot level above 5th. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse.</p>

            <p>You make yourself look like an inconspicuous object, such as a barrel, crate, or statue. The object’s size must be the same as yours, and it must be big enough to fully contain you inside the illusion. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The disguise remains with you if you move.</p>
            <p class="indent">The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add as a crate that is wider than you are, objects pass through crate, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing.</p>
            <p class="indent">To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure a dangerous poison, which retains its potency for the spell’s duration.</p>
            <p class="indent">The effect, duration, and method of application of this poison are determined by the nature of the poison created. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You create a simple poison, which can be applied by any means. You can apply this poisons to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or one piece of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition suffers the poison’s effects. Once a you hit a creature with a poisoned weapon, the weapon ceases to be poisoned. If you hit a creature with this poison, or it ingests or inhales it, it must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 3d6 poison damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
                <li>You replicate the poison of a creature of CR 1 or lower. If the poison requires a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC instead of its normal DC. To create this poison, you must provide a sample of the poison that you are replicating, extracted from a creature that has been dead for no longer than 24 hours, which the spell consumes. If this poison was delivered as part of the creature’s attack, it must be applied by injury. Otherwise, it must be applied by being inhaled or ingested.</li>
                <li>You replicate a purchasable poison worth 200 gp or less (such as assassin’s blood or drow poison). If the poison requires a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC instead of its normal DC. To create such a poison, you must provide supplies worth the same amount as the poison you are replicating, which the spell consumes. You must have a sample of this poison when you cast the spell, or have created this poison using this spell in the past. (The descriptions of these poisons can be found in the Player’s Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage of the simple poison increases by 1d6, the maximum CR of the creature whose poison you can replicate increases by 1, and the maximum cost of the purchasable poison you can replicate increases by 100 gp for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">An Expensive Trade</h5>
                <p>The costs and number of hours required to create purchasable poisons are based on the costs found in the Player’s Handbook and Dungeon Master’s Guide. At the DM’s discretion, the costs of these poisons can be adjusted to better fit your campaign.</p>

            <p class="indent">The ooze is friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the ooze, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to it, it defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. If the ooze is under your control when the spell ends or when it is reduced to 0 hit points, it reverts back to a pile of silver coins.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your concentration is broken, the ooze doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the ooze, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack.</p>

The target must have died violently. Your spell steals the target’s soul, raising it as a specter (the DM has the creature’s game statistics).</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

            <p>You transform your body, sprouting six spines, which last until the spell ends. As an action, you can fire up to two spines at a target within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack for each spine. On a hit, a creature takes piercing damage equal to 2d6 plus your spellcasting modifier. Once you use a spine to make an attack, it is lost. The spell ends if once there are no spines remaining.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, until the spell ends, you can deal 1d6 piercing damage to any creature grappling you at the start of each of your turns.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you grow two additional spines for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>You spray a jet of foul-smelling liquid. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw or be coated in the foul-smelling substance. Until the spell ends, a coated creature exudes a horrible stench. Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a coated creature must make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. Creatures that don’t need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>
            A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.

            <p>You create a coiled serpent in your hand, which you wield like a whip. This serpent lasts until the spell ends. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals 2d4 poison damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and reach properties. In addition, when you hit a creature with this whip, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for the spell’s duration. At the end of each of its turns, a poisoned creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you drop the serpent, you can use a bonus action to summon it back to your hand.</p>
