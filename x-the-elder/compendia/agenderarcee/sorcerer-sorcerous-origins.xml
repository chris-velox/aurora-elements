You may instead spend 2 sorcery points to choose from the list, which you can do after seeing the result of the roll.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can gain two manifestations when you use this feature starting at 9th level, and three when you use it starting at 17th level.

These creatures take 2d8 cold damage, cannot attack, and have their speed reduced to 0.

                <p>Select a point in the air that you can see within 120 feet. When you cast this spell, a heavy mist of humidity forms within a 30-foot sphere around that point. All non-magical flames within that sphere are immediately extinguished, and magical fire deals only half damage.</p>

                <p>You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and additionally is jolted with electricity, and cannot take reactions until after the start of its next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 lightning damage to the target on a hit. The lightning damage increases by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8) and again at 17th level (3d8).</p>

                <p>You conjure up a wave of water that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet and knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked pushed or knocked prone. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames in its area and within 30 feet of it.</p>
