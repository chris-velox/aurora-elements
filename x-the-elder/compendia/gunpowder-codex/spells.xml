            <p class="indent">A leaf-covered, wooden shotgun manifests itself in your hands. You may discharge the firearm by making a ranged spell attack against each target within range; firing the shot disintegrates the wooden weapon. On a hit, the targets take 4d6 piercing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

            <p class="indent">When you cast this spell, a wooden rifle appears in your hands, but grows up to four branching barrels that you can direct at any target you can see within range. This conjured firearm has a range of 80/240 feet (long range imposes disadvantage as normal). Make a separate ranged spell attack against each target; firing these shots disintegrates the weapon. On a hit, the target takes 8d6 piercing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="indent">You place an invisible sensor on one cartridge or musketball that you touch. When that piece of ammunition is fired, you gain a memory of what the sensor saw along the path of the bullet, to a maximum distance of 400 feet. You can see anything along the path of the bullet clearly within 60 feet; anything beyond that is blurry blobs of color and light. What you see is frozen in time at the instant the bullet passed by, but you can examine any part of the image as if you were where the bullet was. The spell does not grant you any special form of sight or vision. You can study this image for up to 10 minutes as long as you can maintain concentration, and then it fades; you still remember what you saw, but you can no longer see or study any new part of it.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the piece of ammunition isn’t fired within 8 hours, the magic dissipates and the spell is wasted.</p>

            <p class="indent">When you cast this spell, a smoothly-carved wooden rifle appears in your hand. This conjured firearm has a range of 100/400 feet (long range imposes disadvantage as normal). Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range; firing the shot disintegrates the weapon. On a hit, the target takes 7d8 piercing damage.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="indent">A howling wind carrying thick dust covers an area in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, and half as much on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">The winds in the area are so strong that making headway is difficult. The storm’s area of effect is difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.</p>

            <p class="indent">A wooden, vine- and leaf-covered appendage grows suddenly on your arm, taking the form of a firearm. Its appearance and size are chosen by you, but its effects remain the same. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range; firing the shot disintegrates the wooden weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell deals additional damage at higher levels: 2d10 at 5th level, 3d10 at 11th level, and 4d10 at 17th level.</p>

            <p class="indent">When you cast this spell, a gnarled wooden revolver appears in your hand. This conjured firearm has the same basic statistics as a mundane revolver, with a range of 40/120 feet (long range imposes disadvantage as normal). Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 piercing damage. As long as you maintain concentration on this spell, you may use your action on subsequent turns to continue firing the gun; as soon as the weapon has been discharged six times, it immediately disintegrates.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
