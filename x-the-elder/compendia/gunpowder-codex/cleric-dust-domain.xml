		<description>
			<p>The Dust domain is most often espoused by clerics that are surrounded by it, who have lived most of their lives in deserts, badlands, plains, prairies, or similar areas. In addition to their command of the earth, they expand their definition of dust to include gunpowder, and make formidable foes. Many different gods can claim influence over this domain, but it finds particular favor with Chauntea, Ilmater, Silvanus, Fharlanghn, Incabulos, Obad-Hai, Ulaa, The Devourer, Moradin, and Semuanya.</p>

When a creature within 30 feet that you can see makes an attack against you or an ally, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing gusts of wind to throw dust at the attacker’s eyes before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.</p>

			<description>
				<p>At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to transform dust or dirt in an area into gunpowder.</p>
				<p class="indent">As an action, choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you. There must be dirt or dust in the area, and it must be relatively dry. You transmute particles of the dirt or dust within a 20-foot-radius of the point you choose into gunpowder. This powder is thoroughly intermingled with the soil and impossible to extract.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the area is covered in grass, underbrush, or is otherwise obscured, the change is unnoticeable and is only revealed by a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigate) check. If the area is exposed, the change in soil color is noticeable with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
				<p class="indent">Any time after seeding an area with gunpowder, it may be ignited as normal by fire, an explosion, or additionally by any spell or effect that touches it with radiant damage. When ignited, the gunpowder explodes, dealing fire damage equal to 7d6 + your cleric level to any creature within the area. A successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw halves the damage. It’s possible that this explosion might set flammable things in the area on fire, but the gunpowder itself is instantly consumed by the explosion.</p>
				<p class="indent">If the seeded area is dampened by rain or another source of water, the powder is inert until it dries (which takes two days). If only part of the area is doused, the dampened areas are safe from any explosion, but creatures in the non-dampened sections are damaged as normal.</p>
