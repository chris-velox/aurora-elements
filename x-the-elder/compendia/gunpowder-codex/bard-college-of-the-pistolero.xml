			<p>Although most bards tell tales of heroes wielding more traditional swords, some prefer to sing ballads about dashing gunslingers, and some even take the time to master the art themselves. These bards are known as pistoleros, simultaneous masters of the arcane, song, and one-handed firearms. Stylish and skillful, these bards are eager to display their fancy moves.</p>

				<p>Upon choosing this bardic college at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely intricate and experimental firearms are only available through crafting.</p>

				<p>At 3rd level, you are supremely deft in handling your guns. When you use the Attack action on your turn and attack with a one-handed firearm, you may attempt one of the following tricks.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Dodger’s Panache.</b> Your experience as a traveling pistolero has made you more adept at staying out of harm’s way. As a bonus action, spend one use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and applying the number rolled as a bonus to your next Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Gun Flourish.</b> You spin your firearm around in a brilliant display of dexterity. As a bonus action, you expend one use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and applying the number rolled as a bonus to one Charisma ability check made within the next minute. If you do not make a Charisma ability check within a minute, the inspiration is wasted.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Trigger Panache.</b> Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and apply the number rolled as a bonus to the next ranged attack roll you make with a one-handed firearm this turn. If the target of the attack is an unattended, inanimate object, the bonus equals double the die roll.</p>

				<p>Beginning at 14th level, you have mastered marksmanship with one-handed firearms. When you miss an attack using a one-handed firearm, you graze your target and still deal a small amount of damage equal to your Dexterity modifier. A critical failure or misfire still results in a complete miss, and no damage is done. You may use this feature only once per turn.</p>
