			<p>You have made a pact with the Eldritch Marksman, the spirit of the first man to craft and wield a gun, whose ability to blend arcane power with deadly iron and gunpowder has never been equalled. While most adventurers believe this figure to be little more than myth, your relationship with the Eldritch Marksman grants you new insight into the use of firearms.</p>
			<div class="sidebar">
				<h5 class="caption">New Pact Boon</h5>
				<p>At 3rd level, warlocks may choose the following new pact boon instead of one of the warlock’s existing Pact Boon options.</p>
				<p class="indent">Pact of Gunpowder. You can use your action to create a number of pieces of firearm ammunition equal to 10 + your Charisma modifier in your empty hand. When loaded into your firearm, these bullets count as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. These pact bullets disappear if they are 5 or more feet away from you for at least 1 round, or 1 hour after you create them. You may use this feature once, and regain the ability to use it after a long rest.</p>
