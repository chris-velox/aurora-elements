			<p>Not everyone who wields a gun prefers to do openly. Some prefer to attack from a distance and stay hidden whenever possible, maximizing the power of a single shot. These rogues are snipers, superb marksmen able to put a bullet in their target from hundreds of feet away and get away with it.</p>

			<description>
				<p>At 3rd level, you gain a set of combat abilities, referred to as maneuvers, which are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Superiority Dice.</b> You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
				<p class="indent">You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Maneuvers.</b> You spend your superiority dice on your maneuvers. You can use more than one maneuver per turn, but no more than one maneuver per attack.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Saving Throws.</b> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
				<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maneuver save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier</p>
				<p class="indent">You know the following maneuvers:</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Disarming Attack.</b> When you hit a creature with a firearm attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it’s holding. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Marksman Shot.</b> When you make an attack with a two-handed firearm against a creature, you can expend one superiority die. This grants you advantage on your attack roll. If you hit, you may roll your superiority die and add the result to the damage of the attack.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Knockdown.</b> When you hit a creature with a firearm attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. Roll the die, and add it to the attack’s damage roll. If the target is Large or smaller, it must also succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
