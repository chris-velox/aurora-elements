		<description>
			<p>The Circle of Thunder is a relatively recent cabal of druids, founded a mere century ago, but is steadily increasing in numbers. As technology progresses and firearms become more common, some druids have felt keenly left behind. Some, fearing obsolescence, have turned to the Circle of Thunder to remain relevant on the battlefield. Others, less concerned with their place in the outside world, nonetheless acknowledge that integrating some aspects of firearm technology into their natural magic can aid them in defending the places most important to them.</p>

			<description>
				<p>Your magical connection with the forest and careful study of firearms gives you the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells related to the discipline of Thunder.</p>
				<p class="indent">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, it is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

				<p>At 14th level, when you use a spell or cantrip to create a wooden firearm, a latticed cage of bracken briefly grows from the ground and surrounds you protectively. You gain half cover in all directions until the beginning of your next turn, and the cage does not interfere with attacks or spellcasting. You can easily break out of the cage if you choose, but you lose its protective bonus if you do so or leave the space where it formed. You must be within five feet of solid ground for this cage to form (normally, this means standing on the ground, but at the DM’s discretion it could activate if you were flying within 5 feet of a cliff face, or swimming in very shallow water).</p>
