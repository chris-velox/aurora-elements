		<description>
			<p>While many sorcerers draw their power from some ancient, revered, or mystical source, Powderbloods draw theirs from an unfortunate accident that occurred at some point in their lives. All at some time experienced a disastrous miscalculation when working with black powder, and the resulting explosion blended with latent magical forces to imbue them with innate magic and understanding of gunpowder. Rare and often eccentric, powderbloods are nonetheless a formidable force on the battlefield.</p>
