        <description>
            <p>This firearm looks much like any other of its type, but has simple enchantments upon it that increase its reliability. Its Misfire score is lowered by 1 (to a minimum of 1), and it possesses 3 magical charges. When making an attack, you may spend 1 charge to grant advantage on the next attack roll you make with the Cowboy’s Sidearm. The Sidearm regains one charge at each dawn.</p>

            <p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">Carved into the stock of this rifle is a single elvish rune representing the foe the weapon is dedicated to slaying. A fiercebane weapon excels at attacking one type or subtype of creature, which the creator chose when enchanting it. Once per turn, when you hit a target of the chosen type, you may choose to deal 2d6 extra radiant damage against the creature. Whenever it strikes its designated fiercebane enemy, it begins to emit a low, eager hum, as if it were actually feeding off the victim’s life blood.</p>
            <p class="indent">A fiercebane rifle glows when a designated foe comes within 60 feet, even if you cannot see or detect it. In addition, the weapon deals 1d10 extra radiant damage on every critical hit (against any type of creature).</p>

        <description>
            <p>It is not age or eons of history that makes an artifact powerful; it is its direct connection to higher power. Such is the case for the Reaper’s Hand, an artifact that entered legend a mere century ago. Emblazoned with the silver symbol of a skull and scythe on the handle, this revolver was commissioned by a cleric of Nerull and built by the finest gunsmith in the land. When it was completed, the cleric used the gun to kill the smith, and then baptized the weapon in his blood.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dark rituals followed, undertaken by a cabal of priests for a hundred days, the revolver used to kill a new sacrifice each day. At the end, Nerull allowed a sliver of his power to flow into the gun, and a legend was born.</p>
            <p class="indent">In the time since its creation, the Reaper’s Hand has been used by a spellgunner to murder an entire village, a bandit king carried it during an infamous string of robberies and raids, and a prostitute killed a prince and his household with it. In each instance, tales spread of an onyx-black revolver that never needed to be reloaded. The gun has changed hands many times, but the dark deity’s influence continues to linger upon it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Reaper’s Hand is a magic, sentient revolver that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. Shots from it deal an extra 2d10 psychic damage to good-aligned creatures. Any time it isn’t fully loaded, the revolver will magically create one adamantine cartridge to fill an empty chamber at the beginning of the wielder’s turn, and will do so each turn until it is fully loaded again. Attempting to remove these pieces of ammunition from the gun causes them to immediately disappear.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the Reaper’s Hand isn’t used to kill at least one creature every 24 hours, its wielder must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 2d12 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the revolver, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the Reaper’s Hand compels the wielder to attack the creature nearest to them. The spell effect ends when the gun has been used to kill a creature, or if it is dispelled.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Random Properties.</i></b> The Reaper’s Hand has the following random properties (see page 219 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 minor beneficial property</li>
                <li>1 major beneficial property</li>
                <li>1 minor detrimental property</li>
                <li>1 major detrimental property</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Quickdraw.</i></b> While the revolver is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells.</i></b> While the gun is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: <i>vampiric touch</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, or <i>finger of death</i>. Once you use the revolver to cast a spell, you can’t cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sentience. The Reaper’s Hand is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 11, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 90 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Abyssal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Personality.</i></b> The revolver’s purpose is pure destruction and death, and it revels in killing, whether calculated or random. Its goal is to send continual sacrifices to Nerull, and as such it frequently urges its wielder toward acts of violence and murder, heedless of consequence or danger. Any time it has been used to kill, it expresses satisfaction and will usually stay quiet for a time.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Destroying the Reaper’s Hand.</i></b> Although never proven, scholars and clerics are confident that the only workable method for destroying the Reaper’s Hand is to essentially perform its creation ritual in reverse. This would involve returning a murdered soul to life every day for one hundred days, within the same room as the revolver. Many scholars also think that were these rituals to be done within the halo of the Book of Exalted Deeds, the time and resurrections needed might be halved.</p>

This effect is negated by silence spells and effects.</p>
            <p class="indent">The blindsight property lasts for 1 minute, and the Seer’s Pistol regains 1d3 charges at dawn.</p>

            <p>Wisps of inky black smoke perpetually rise from the barrel of this gun, where glowing red runes are etched into the metal. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and any time an attack from the Smoking Gun hits a target, it takes an additional 1d10 necrotic damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Furthermore, once per day you may use your action to magically overcharge this firearm. The smoke from the barrel is sucked inward for just a moment before detonating in a burst of necrotic energy. You are not affected, but every creature within 20 feet takes 10d10 necrotic damage, or half damage on a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you use this ability, the Smoking Gun ceases to function entirely until the following dawn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This spell-storing weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon (the spell must have a casting time of an action or bonus action.) After casting the spell as normal into the weapon, any time the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. Inflict wounds, lightning bolt, blindness/deafness, and hold person are all common choices for the stored spell. Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it.</p>
