		<description>
			<p>Often hailing from lawless lands, paladins who take the Oath of Resolve know better than anyone that righteousness is hard to attain. These paladins know that life is rough, and that is impossible to truly live without getting dust on your boots. They hold that righteousness is not a state of being, but rather a choice that must be made and a struggle that must be won every day. Paladins who take the Oath of Resolve do not idealize perfect, heroic figures. Instead, they hold up as examples ordinary people struggling to improve their lives, and strike down any who would prey on such folk.</p>

			<description>
				<p>Though the exact words and strictures of Oath of Resolve vary, paladins of this Oath share these tenets.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Strive Always.</b> Character shows up best when tested. The greater the struggle, the greater value there is to find in the result. No cause is truly lost so long as someone strives after it.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Only You Can Save Yourself.</b> No matter your lot in life, you determine your own actions. If you find yourself in a hole, first thing to do is stop digging. The second thing to do is start climbing. Always be willing to throw the climbers some rope.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Charity to the Weak.</b> Not everyone has the stones to strive for righteousness. Lead by example, and those that can will follow. Be kind to those that cannot strive, and care for them when possible.</p>
				<p class="indent"><b>Examples Must be Made.</b> There are those who take advantage of life’s adversity and strive against righteousness. The people must be shown that such villains will always be overcome in the end.</p>

			<description>
				<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to bond your oath with a firearm to create a sacred piece. Any time you hit a creature with an attack using your sacred piece, you may apply your divine smite feature. After you reach 11th level, you may also apply your improved divine smite feature to attacks made with your sacred piece. Additionally, any paladin spell you cast that applies to melee weapon attacks also applies to attacks with your sacred piece.</p>
				<p class="indent">Creating a sacred piece is a holy ritual requiring one hour of uninterrupted concentration. If your bonded firearm is destroyed or lost, you may bond to a new firearm by spending another hour and paladin spell slot to repeat the ritual.</p>
				<p class="indent">When you take this Oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
