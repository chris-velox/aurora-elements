			<p>While many who use firearms do so merely for power, to make an impression, or for tactical reasons, monks known as firedancers have turned the use of small guns into an art form. Gracefully dancing between opponents, firing at close range and deflecting enemy attacks, firedancers are whirlwinds on the battlefield.</p>

				<p>Beginning at 3rd level, making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on your roll. Additionally, if you make an attack with a one-handed firearm and no creature other than your target is within 5 feet of you, you may spend a ki point to gain advantage on the attack roll. You may use this ability only once per round.</p>

Whenever an enemy that you can see within 15 feet of you makes a ranged weapon attack against you or an ally, you may use your reaction and spend 1 ki point to make a flying leap. You may move up to 15 feet in this leap, and when landing you impact your target enough to impose disadvantage on their ranged attack roll.</p>

				<p>At 17th level, you can reload your guns with preternatural grace and speed.

You may load one additional piece of ammunition into each gun for every 5 that you exceed the DC (2 bullets at 15, 3 at 20, et cetera).</p>
