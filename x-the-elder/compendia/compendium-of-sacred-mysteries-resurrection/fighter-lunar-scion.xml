            <p>Some claim that the moon brings madness, its cold glow staring down upon the world as a pale imitation of the sun’s true light. You know better, for you are a scion of the moon, its sacred fury gleaming with celestial hatred upon those that defile the it with lies and blasphemies. Truth is your watchword, as the revelations those like you seek to bring are often unwelcome. Tear through the night, weapon in hand, and cut the darkness like a knife.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, your devotion to the cleansing light of the moon allows you to wield it as a weapon against your foes. When you take the Attack action, you can sacrifice an attack to perform a sacred strike, called an axiom. You can use each axiom not more than once during each of your turns.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Scour.</b> You unleash a crescent-shaped blast of lunar light in a 15-foot cone. Each hostile creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. If a creature fails, it takes radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier and is marked by motes of pale light until the end of your next turn.</li>
                    <li><b>Cascade.</b> You warp moonlight into a barrier around yourself, gaining temporary hit points equal to your fighter level that last until the start of your next turn and surrounding yourself with orbs of destructive light. When a hostile creature is within 5 feet of you while you have these temporary hit points, you can cause the orbs to strike it and vanish, causing it to take radiant damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).</li>
                    <li><b>Sentence.</b> You imbue your weapon with moonlight, making a melee weapon attack with a weapon you are wielding. If the attack hits, the target and all hostile creatures within 5 feet you take 1d6 radiant damage.</li>
