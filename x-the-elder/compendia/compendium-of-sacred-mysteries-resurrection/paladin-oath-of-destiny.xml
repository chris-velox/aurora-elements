            <p>There are many forces within the cosmos that claim to manipulate fate itself, but even they are tools within the great weave. The cards and dice these diviners cast are to be heeded and understood, for their acts are equally under the control of fate. You have sworn to act in accordance to the whims of the cosmic weave, following the path laid out before you. Whether hero or villain, chosen champion or fallen outcast, you will fulfill your destiny.</p>

                <p>The tenets of the Oath of Destiny are deterministic, and all paladins who travel this road end up swearing to these:</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Know Your Fate.</em></strong> You have a purpose in life or in death. Find it, and understand it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Walk The Path.</em></strong> Every act you perform will be in alignment with your fate. Do not fight against it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fight By Instinct.</em></strong> If you are meant to kill, then you shall. If you are meant to save, then you shall. Do not deny the destinies of others.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Live and Die.</em></strong> The end of the road is inescapable and unavoidable, but your destination does not invalidate your journey.</p>

                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fate Foretold.</em></strong> As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to seal a creature’s fate. Choose a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. The next time the creature takes damage within 1 minute, it takes twice as much damage instead.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Linked Destiny.</em></strong> You can touch a friendly creature as a bonus action to bind your fates together. For 1 minute, whenever one of you regains hit points, the other regains half as many hit points.</p>
