        <description>
            <p>You are a prisoner, trapped within a cage of flesh and bone. You devoured the mind of your captor, feasted upon their memories, but the seals and wards those wretched, cunning mortals etched into its skin are steadfast and self-repairing. You speak in the voice of the one you’ve consumed and play along with the indignity, concealing the fact that if the shell you are trapped within dies, then you will be banished to the afterlife in place of the soul you consumed. They are afraid of your nature, though they may not know what you truly are. You will be freed. Nine seals stand in your way, and the first is ever so delightfully fragile.</p>
            <p class="indent">Smile, nightmare, for your time has come.</p>
