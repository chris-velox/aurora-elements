        <description>
            <p>For every light, there is a shadow equally dark. The divine powers are opposed in equal force by the foul things that lurk beyond the radiant grace of the sun, and it is in this balance between the forces of chaos, law, good, and evil that the mortal races can live and thrive. Such is the order of things, and thus, that balance must be protected. Ma’at, Tefnut, Shamash, Obatala, Rao, Cindor, Nemesis, and Adrestia, as well as other gods of justice, balance, equilibrium, vengeance, and peace may hold sway over the domain of balance. Your task, as an arbiter of these ancient gods, is to maintain the balance of the cosmic order by quelling what threats are within your power. Bring ruin where it is needed, and salvation where there is none to be found.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, you learn to call forth spells that bring balance to the magical energies you unleash. Whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you can choose to change one or more damage types from that spell to a different damage type, according to the following table, by switching the damage type to its opposite. For example, when you cast flame strike, you can change the fire damage to cold damage, the radiant damage to necrotic damage, or both.</p>
