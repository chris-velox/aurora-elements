        <description>
            <p>A princess in a sumptuous gown lightly descends a grand staircase. A hush falls over the crowd and all eyes turn to take in her beauty. Struck breathless, no-one in the room can look away, not even to notice her companions filtering silently through the crowd.</p>
            <p class="indent">In the blink of an eye one halfling becomes four. Dancing and tumbling between an ogre’s legs, they twist and turn the brute into a dazed heap of confoundment.</p>
            <p class="indent">On a high clifftop, four cold and shivering travelers wait in front of a misty purple circle glowing out from the rocks. Finally, the light of the portal snaps to a gentle soft white and they wearily trudge forwards into it, moving ever onwards to higher peaks.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Mesmer is a master of manipulation, twisting the senses and the mind. To unravel a Mesmer’s delusions is to shatter the mind, and embracing their reality is a trap that might never be escaped. A Cleric might say that belief is a powerful force, strong enough to topple empires and raise gods. The Mesmer’s motto answers: “Seeing is believing.”</p>
            <h4>MIND MAGES</h4>
            <p>Mesmers are focused first and foremost on thoughts, feelings, the activity of the mind. From the conscious and coherent ideas of the sentient races to the wild untamed impulses of flora and fauna, everything must think to be. Using this type of magic effectively is a difficult task. A Mesmer must be able to deduce any given thought or feeling, predict the stimuli to twist that thought in just the right way, and recall the arcane magic needed to apply that twist precisely and powerfully.</p>
            <p class="indent">The pursuit of these studies can take a lifetime, but the results reach far beyond mundane conceptions of thought or sentience. A true master might be able to read the iron mind of a clockwork watch and fool time itself, or peer at the deep cosmic dreams of the world and heavens.</p>
            <h4>ILLUSORY WORLD</h4>
            <p>A Mesmer’s grip over the mind can be utter and total, even to the extent of warping reality itself. If everyone and everything hears, sees, and feels a tree fall, hasn’t one fallen? Mesmer magic can make it so. The first thing a Mesmer learns is that the fabric of reality comprises one great shared delusion, one that’s as malleable as any other.</p>
            <p class="indent">The counterpart to this truth is an equally valid fact: the best illusion is something real. The most intricate glamours can’t compare with a natural beauty, no illusory wound will kill as surely as a slit throat, and the easiest way to make an appearance somewhere else is quite simply to walk over.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Mesmer makes use of all these tools to weave illusions and reality together, creating something much more than the sum of its parts. As solid as silk and fleeting as a mountain, a true lie that bends and warps the instant it feels solid enough to trust.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A MESMER</h4>
            <p>A Mesmer is a master of the mind, and as a Mesmer your own mind is your defining characteristic. How do you ponder, guess, dream, and feel? These characteristics are as unique as a fingerprint, and they leave an equally unique mark on the magic you will wield.</p>
            <p class="indent">Perhaps you are an artful painter, always imagining creative new illusions to draw forth into the world. Or an empirical experimenter, one that studies the brains of your foes by watching them scurry like rats. Maybe you prefer to puzzle and ponder, and you have a head filled with riddles and clever games just waiting to be played. Whatever the nature of your mind may be, so too are you as a Mesmer.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Mesmer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma or Dexterity. Second, choose the Charlatan background.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 1st level, your magic can generate confounding images of yourself. When you cast a spell using a spell slot, you may create an illusion of yourself in any space you can see within 30 feet of you or a target of that spell. It is an insubstantial image of yourself along with anything you are wearing or holding. It rotates to face the same direction you do, and always mimics all of your motions. It’s an intangible image, so if its position or motion would cause it to collide with terrain or objects, it intersects through them instead.</p>
                <p class="indent">As a bonus action you can command one of your clones to move up to 120 feet in the manner of your choice to another location you can see. For example, you can have a clone cartwheel over the ground or swim through the air.</p>
                <p class="indent">You may have no more than 3 clones at a time. You can freely dismiss any of your clones at any time. A clone fades away on its own after one minute.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you create a clone you may choose to concentrate on maintaining it for up to one hour, and if you do it doesn’t fade away until you end your concentration.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your clones are precise visual duplicates of yourself, but that does not mean they are always perfectly convincing. If a creature witnesses a clone being created or observes a clone doing something obviously illusory, it automatically recognizes the clone as an illusion. Creatures may lose track of which clones are false under sufficiently confusing circumstances, such as heavy obscuration, invisibility, or after being knocked unconscious. Your clones mimic your visual appearance, meaning they are invisible when you are.</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5 class="caption">Tip: How Deceptive are Clones?</h5>
                    <p>Any “obviously illusory” action will cause creatures to recognize a clone as an illusion. What constitutes “obviously” is highly dependent on the observer’s intelligence and wisdom and should be adjudicated on a contextual basis.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Giveaways might include a clone appearing to talk without making a sound, swinging a sword at nothing at all, intersecting with a solid object, or standing in midair. If a clone is attacked or subjected to a spell, the attack or spell simply passes through it with no effect and any creatures witnessing that occurrence recognize the clone as an illusion. A creature that suspects a clone of being an illusion can make an Investigation check against the caster’s spell save DC to successfully recognize the target as a clone, or it may do something else that will otherwise test the clone. A cyclops would likely try to toss a rock at the clone, whereas a well-traveled diplomat might merely wave a hand through it to confirm her suspicions.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Unless Mesmers are a rarity in your world, you should assume that intelligent creatures will be somewhat aware of a Mesmer’s tricks from past experiences, stories, or legends. Clones are a Mesmer’s basic tools, and do not constitute effective illusions without some further support or application of creativity.</p>

                <p>A Mesmer is capable of wielding magic at 1st level to confuse the mind and twist the senses. See chapter 10 in the <i>Player's Handbook</i> for the general rules of spellcasting and page 6 of this resource for the Mesmer spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Mesmer spell list. You learn additional Mesmer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Mesmer table.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Mesmer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Mesmer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Mesmer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Mesmer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Mesmer table shows when you learn more Mesmer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Mesmer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Mesmer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Mesmer spells, since the power of your magic depends on your study of the mind and your knowledge of emotions and thoughts. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Mesmer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Mesmer spells.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When something once thought true is revealed to be an illusion, reality breaks and reforms in a moment of power. Beginning at 2nd level you may take an action to disrupt reality, dispelling all your clones simultaneously. Each one fractures into glimmering shards, suspended for an instant throughout a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that clone’s last location. Creatures you choose within those areas must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC, as the shards splinter and fade. Each time you wish to Shatter Illusions, first choose one of the following effects:</p>
                <p class="indent">Shatter Mind: You tear minds to shreds. Deal 1d8 psychic damage to creatures that fail the saving throw, or half as much damage to creatures that succeed. Creatures may be dealt multiple instances of this damage by the same saving throw if they are within overlapping areas of multiple clones you shattered. This effect’s damage per clone increases by 1d8 at certain Mesmer levels: 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
                <p class="indent">Shatter Will: You convince creatures that their efforts are futile. Creatures that fail the saving throw have disadvantage on ability checks until the end of your next turn. You may also choose to Shatter Illusions using this effect as a reaction, only when a creature that would be in the area misses an attack. If you shatter this way and the attacking creature is affected, that creature also has disadvantage on attacks and saving throws for the same duration.</p>
                <p class="indent">Shatter Clarity: You reveal something awful and incredible beneath the illusion. Creatures that fail the saving throw are charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for up to a minute. While charmed or frightened by this effect a creature believes all your clones to be real, dismissing and instantly forgetting any evidence to the contrary. A creature charmed or frightened by this effect can make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>

                <p>Mesmers learn that all reality is illusory, but some elements of this beautiful lie bend more freely than others. A Mesmer may learn how to work especially powerful and unique magic by manipulating these particularly frangible elements of the world. Often the grand deception that calls to a Mesmer reflects their own patterns of thought, the unique flavor of their mind and personality.</p>
                <p class="indent">Also at 2nd level, you begin to learn about a particularly elaborate and pervasive element of the illusory world around you. Your choices are described in the following section of this document.</p>

You can attempt to use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

When you cast a spell using a spell slot, you can expend your bonus action or action, and a spell slot of the same level, to have one of your clones cast the same spell simultaneously.

            <p>The most sinister of the deceptions a Mesmer can learn to wield is that of Domination. Ownership, possession, property: Mesmers may not be the only scholars who know how mutable these concepts are, but they are the best equipped to use them as tools of wrath and discipline. A Mesmer that specializes in Domination is an expert at grasping minds and tearing them apart.</p>

Whenever a creature would pass a saving throw to end a charm or fright condition that you applied to it, you can make an Intelligence (Deception) check against their result. If your result exceeds theirs, they fail their saving throw instead. This is an attempt to twist the mind with Mesmer magic, not to interact socially with a creature, so you do not benefit from the charmed condition for the purpose of this feature. If the target used a feature which allowed it to freely pass the contested saving throw, such as Legendary Resistance, it may also freely exceed this check.</p>

            <description>
                <p>You create a veil of illusion on a solid surface in range. The veil is an invisible, intangible sheet extending perpendicular from the surface. You can make the veil up to 60 feet long and 30 feet high, and its base can be curved into any continuous configuration you choose including a closed circle. As you create the veil choose one side to be the front side. When creatures look through the veil from the front, they can’t see creatures on the other side of it, as if those creatures were invisible. Looking through the veil from the back has no effect. Creatures with blindsight are unaffected by this spell. Creatures that can see invisibility are unaffected and see the veil itself as a translucent grey film.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the maximum length, height, and range of the wall all increase by 30 feet for each slot level above 4th.</p>

            <description>
                <p>You establish a protective globe of inversive magic. Target a point within range and wrap your magic around a 30-foot radius sphere centered on it. While you concentrate a continuous sheet of wavering light covers the outside surface of that sphere. The magic of this spell is clearly visible, but sufficiently transparent to avoid impairing vision. Magical and physical projectiles which intersect the surface of this spell are reflected back to their origins. Attacks and projectile-based spells have their targets altered but are otherwise unchanged. For example, an archer firing into the area would roll to hit against its own AC and roll damage against itself, and a Fireball cast outward through the sphere would streak back and explode at the tip of its caster’s finger. The magic of this spell is otherwise intangible and does not interfere with movement.</p>
