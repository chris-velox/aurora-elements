        <description>
            <p>A crackling white bolt of lightning sears into the ground and a thundering blast of superheated air tosses a gang of goblins to the ground. Flashing out of the space between sparks, a single ancient elf strides forth with ozone boiling out of his eyes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Flowing and weaving through the waves, a goliath scoops downwards through the water with powerful strokes. Fish of a dozen colors and ancient blooming strands of sea kelp dance all around her.</p>
            <p class="indent">Flickering flames leap and dance from a tabaxi trader’s golden claws, casting glimmering reflections on the eyes of a dozen fascinated strangers as he regales them with tales of his wares, hard won from the Elemental Plane of Fire.</p>
            <p class="indent">The world is composed of four elements. Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. Their constant intermingling, coexistence, and conflict generates the fundamental energy of existence and life. An Elementalist embraces this energy, bonding intimately with the very fabric of the world, twisting and shaping earth, sea, sun and sky to their will.</p>
            <h4>A WILD POWER</h4>
            <p>Elementalists spend their time in constant meditation and learning, but not from scrolls or dusty tomes. The elements are best understood in their rawest form, as they appear in nature. An Elementalist might spend a lifetime absorbed in the way water tumbles over a great fall, or travel to a far-off volcano in search of its fiery secrets. These pursuits often bring them to wild frontiers, where the elements are still untamed by civilization. Many become wanderers and hermits, endlessly seeking new manifestations of elemental energy in ever more remote bastions of wilderness.</p>
            <h4>FOUR ELEMENTS, ONE MASTER</h4>
            <p>No element can stand alone without the others. The world is defined by the balance of all four elements, and no-one knows the importance of their interplay better than an Elementalist. When one element predominates over the other, the wielder of that element can become dangerously skewed. An inexperienced fire mage may find themselves developing an awful temper, while one that wields the power of freezing ice too readily may lose joy and vigor, sinking into a cold depression.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some masters choose to embrace this imbalance, taking advantage of a certain element’s most powerful aspects and checking the downsides with rigorous discipline. Others cultivate an equal dominion over all the elements, dancing from one to the next with perfect grace.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ELEMENTALIST</h4>
            <p>Elementalists are defined by their experience of the world around them. Looking upon a grazing horse, one might feel the presence of the earth in its hard hooves and the grass it plucks from the ground to sustain itself. Another might see its steaming breath, and the flash of flaming pride in its eyes. The breeze through its mane might conjure the memory of freedom as it gallops across rolling hills chasing the wind, or the flowing ripples of its limbs might recall the beating tide of life that sustains all creatures. How does your character experience the elements?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>

            <description>
                <p>At 1st level, you have learned to align your mind and body with a particular element, bringing that element’s magic to the forefront of your awareness. You have four separate entwinement dice which represent the four elements: 1d6 for Fire, 1d8 for Water, 1d10 for Air, and 1d12 for Earth. As a bonus action, you may spend any one of those dice to become entwined with the corresponding element.</p>
                <p class="indent">Being entwined with an element is a lasting condition. Your entwinement with an element ends when you entwine with a different element. When you entwine with a new element, you also regain one expended entwinement die of your choice. You may not choose to regain the die of either the element you are leaving or the element you are entering entwinement with.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you entwine with a new element, you may produce an instant magical effect related to that element:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Fire:</b> Searing Nova: Flames surge out from you. Deal (1d6) fire damage to yourself. Neither resistance nor immunity can reduce the damage you take. All other creatures within 10 feet of you are dealt the same damage you dealt to yourself.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Water:</b> Soothing Mist: A puff of cool, soothing mist bursts out from you, settling over each creature within 10 feet of you. When you use a spell to restore hit points to a creature shrouded by this mist, that creature regains (1d8) bonus hit points and the mist around it fades away. This mist fades from all affected creatures at the end of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Air:</b> Electric Discharge: A lightning bolt flashes down, striking at a single creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking (1d10) lightning damage on a failure or avoiding the damage entirely on a success.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Earth:</b> Armor of Earth: Pebbles and stones rise around you, granting you a protective barrier. When you are hit by an attack while entwined with Earth you may reduce the damage you take by (1d12). You have one use of this feature and regain all uses when you entwine with Earth.</p>
                <p class="indent">The magnitude ( ) of each effect is increased by an additional corresponding entwinement die when you achieve your 5th, 11th, and 17th levels in this class. The radii of Searing Nova and Soothing Mist are increased by 5 feet and the range of Electric Discharge is increased by 30 feet when you achieve your 11th Elementalist level, and again at 17th level.</p>

            <description>
                <p>An Elementalist is capable of wielding magic at 1st level to exert their mastery over the base components of the world. Elemental magic is volatile and unique, governed by special rules described in this section. See chapter 10 in the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and page 7 of this resource for the Elementalist spell list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN AND PREPARED</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know all the cantrips and 1st level spells on the Elementalist spell list. When you first gain a spell slot of a certain spell level, you also learn all the Elementalist spells of that spell level.</p>
                <p class="indent">You must have a spell prepared to cast it, and you prepare spells by entwining with elements using the Elemental Entwinement feature as follows:</p>
                <p class="indent">While you are entwined with an element, you have all of the spells you know from that element’s section of the Elementalist spell list prepared to cast, and you lose access to any others. While you are not entwined with an element, you do not have any spells of that element prepared.</p>
                <p class="indent">You may maintain your concentration on a spell even if you lose access to it by entwining with a different element.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Elementalist spells, as their power derives from your awareness of and connection with the elements and their properties. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Elementalist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an elemental focus as your spellcasting focus for your Elementalist spells. An elemental focus is a small token or artifact which helps an Elementalist deepen their bond with elements and the physical world. A glowing coal held at the end of a staff, a pendent vial filled with everfrozen ice, or a dark gem hewn from the heart of a forgotten cave may all serve as elemental foci.</p>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast an Elementalist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

            <description>
                <p>As an Elementalist deepens their connection with the bare aspects of the natural world, they may take on some of the signature characteristics of the four elements. These traits are reflected in an Elementalist’s personality, thoughts, demeanor, and the magic they wield. At 2nd level, you are an Initiate in the ways of elemental magic. You may choose any Initiate tier trait. At 5th level you will become an Adept, at 9th level you will become a Master, and at 14th level you will become a Grandmaster. You can choose any trait at each tier, whether of a consistent theme with or differing completely from the traits you selected previously.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach 2nd level you may select one Initiate tier trait to learn. At 5th level you may select one trait of Adept tier or lower learn. At 9th level you may select on trait of Master tier or lower to learn. At 14th level you may select one trait of Grandmaster tier or lower to learn.</p>
                <p class="indent">At the end of a long rest, you can replace any one trait you have with a different one that is available to you. You cannot have traits from a certain tier unless you have at least 1 trait from each lower tier. For example, at level 5 you can have 1 Initiate trait and 1 Adept trait or 2 Initiate traits and no Adept traits, but you may not have 2 Adept traits with no Initiate traits.</p>

                <p>Also at 2nd level, your bond to the elements manifests visibly. When you are entwined with an element, a minor manifestation of that element springs up around your body and follows you. For example, flames might flicker out of your eyes, or small crystals may wrap around your wrists like bracelets. Icy mist could swirl in your path, or a gentle breeze loft through your hair. The precise nature of this effect is up to your conscious choice and you can suppress this occurrence at your will.</p>

                <p>Upon reaching 18th level, you have strengthened your bond with the elements to the point that you can channel catastrophic power.

For the next hour your existing entwinements are not ended by entwining with a new element, you may activate any of Elemental Entwinement’s magical effects as a bonus action without entwining, and you may use Chaotic Entwinement at any time, selecting from the damage types of any spell you have prepared. Channeling the elements this way takes a terrible toll, and you cannot easily close yourself to this power. You cannot leave this state until it ends. At the end of the hour you gain one level of exhaustion and end all your entwinements, regaining all spent entwinement dice.</p>

                <p>At 20th level, you are an unsurpassed grandmaster of the elements. Channeling the four elements comes as easily to you as breathing, and the scale of your powers can only be described as cataclysmic. Elemental Overload no longer exhausts you. When you are entwined with all four elements, you may expend any number of spell slots to trigger some monumental elemental event. Work with your DM to determine an appropriate contextual occurrence. The scale of this event should depend on the number of slots expended. An Elementalist unleashing all their power can accomplish feats like raising a river to flood, triggering a volcanic eruption, or turning a mountain into a valley.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Choose two points you can see within range that have only unoccupied space between them. A thin electric arc leaps through the air, suspending itself between the two target points. While it persists, it gives off a subtly audible crackle and sheds dim light across a 5-foot radius around itself. If an object or creature contacts the arc, they must make a Constitution saving throw. They suffer 2d10 lightning damage and become stunned until the end of their next turn if they fail or take half the damage and are not stunned if they pass. Pass or fail, the arc then snaps out of existence with a loud thunderclap audible from as far away as 300 feet. If the duration expires before the trap is triggered, it fizzles away silently, leaving no trace. If you cast this spell again while an arc trap you cast previously persists, the previous trap fizzles away instantly.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage is increased by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

                <p>A wave of refreshing water splashes out from you, healing wounds and washing away filth. All creatures in a 10-foot radius sphere centered on yourself regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier. If any creatures in the area are poisoned or diseased, this spell cures one of those ailments on each of those creatures (their choice). This spell does not restore hit points to undead or constructs.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, for each slot level above 2nd, the radius is increased by 5 feet and it cures an additional ailment on each affected creature.</p>

                <p>An earthen blast launches you into the air along an arcing trajectory, which you may make up to 30 feet high and 15 feet long horizontally. This movement doesn’t trigger opportunity attacks. If you are not standing on a solid surface when you cast this spell, you forgo the movement portion of this spell. The next time you touch the ground this turn, if you fell at least 10 feet immediately prior, you land with cratering force. You don’t take fall damage from this impact, and all other creatures on the ground within 5 feet of you must then make a Strength saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw take 2d12 bludgeoning damage and are pushed 10 feet directly away from you. Creatures that pass take only half the damage and are not pushed. The ground within 5 feet of you becomes difficult terrain which lasts until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, for each slot level above 2nd, the damage is increased by 1d12 and the maximum height of the arc is increased by 30 feet.</p>

                <p>Call forth the roiling heat of the earth to create a magical gout of lava. Choose a point on the ground within range, and lava surges up to the surface. A volume of lava sufficient to occupy the base of a five-foot cube to one-foot depth flows out as a thick liquid, remaining in a single location if the ground is flat or flowing in a cohesive globule at a rate of up to 5 feet per round on a slope. A creature that walks across the lava takes 6d6 fire damage for every five feet of lava it crosses, and if a creature ends its turn on the lava it takes 12d6 fire damage. Lava is unimaginably hot and heavy. This volume of molten rock weighs 5000 pounds. It ignites flammable objects and structures near it and will slowly melt stone and metal it remains in contact with. This lava magically cools into a smooth, glassy black stone when this spell ends.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, for each slot level above 3rd, another identical volume of lava is created in an adjacent location you choose.</p>

                <p>Call on a massive upswelling of enchanted water to surge up from a point you choose on the ground within range. The water mounds up into a 15-foot high, 15-foot radius hemi-spherical dome. Creatures in the area are rejuvenated by the rising water, regaining hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting modifier. The mass of water then collapses downwards, washing outwards along the ground to extinguish unprotected flames and carry away loose objects. Creatures in the area must pass a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 15 feet directly away from the origin. A creature may freely choose to fail this saving throw, opting to let themselves be carried by the water and pushed twice as far. If the movement of a creature pushed by this spell is interrupted by a hard surface or obstacle, that creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage from the collision. This spell does not restore hit points to undead or constructs.</p>

                <p>Fine sand swirls out from you, churning through the air throughout a cylindrical area of 30-foot radius and 80-foot height. The origin of the storm is your location, and if you are elevated in the air for any reason the storm also extends downwards from you towards the ground, for a distance up to its maximum height. The storm spreads around corners. The area is heavily obscured, and creatures within have disadvantage on perception checks made using hearing or smell. Unprotected air-breathing creatures within the area must hold their breath or begin to suffocate. A creature attempting to fly in the area must spend five feet of movement for each foot it moves. When a creature ends its turn in the area it takes 3d4 slashing and 3d4 piercing damage. The swirling area of the storm does not include a central eye, which is a 10-foot radius cylinder of the same height as the storm, also centered on you. The eye of the storm is perfectly calm, and not subject to any of the effects of this spell. Both the storm and the eye move with you.</p>

Neither resistance nor immunity can reduce the damage you take. The torrent of flame fills a 15-foot radius, 600-foot-height cylinder rising from your body, flaring upwards into the sky.

The pillar of flame ignites objects and burns clean through flammable obstacles, such as wooden structures or shingle roofs.
