            <p>An ornate copper lantern, speckled with a matte, teal tarnish. Small, glowing, turquoise orbs chase one another around the interior of the glass cylinder, the shifting patterns of light mirroring their play.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Glitter Bomb.</em></strong> As an action, you can throw this lantern up to 60 feet. The lantern shatters, casting faerie fire (save DC 13) centred on its point of impact and requiring no components, nor concentration. Creatures within 5 feet of its impact have disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist this effect.</p>

    <element name="Nullhelm of Amnosious" type="Magic Item" source="Humperdink’s Wares" id="ID_HDW_MAGIC_ITEM_NULLHELM_OF_AMNOSIOUS">
        <description>
            <p>Whilst attuned to this helm, your body is always under the effect of an antimagic field; you cannot be affected by spells or other magical effects (including healing), beneficial or otherwise, except those granted by this helm. You have immunity to psychic damage, the charmed condition, know the cantrip can’trip*, and are always under the effects of the comprehend languages spell. In addition, you cannot communicate or be contacted via telepathy.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> You may channel the nullhelm to cast the following spells, which may be upcast to the level specified in brackets. When you do so, roll a d10. If the result is less than or equal to the level at which you cast the spell, you may not use the nullhelm in this way again until you finish a long rest. The helm has a spellcasting ability modifier of +5; the DC for a spell cast using the helm equals 13 plus the wearer’s proficiency bonus.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>cannotrip*</em> (5th-level max)</li>
                <li><em>counterspell</em> (5th-level max)</li>
                <li><em>Firther’s shadow*</em> (5th-level max)</li>
                <li><em>modify memory</em> (9th-level max)</li>
                <li><em>antimagic field</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Forgetful.</em></strong> Whilst attuned to this helm, you find yourself forgetting why you walked up the stairs or what you wanted to buy. Write a list of memories, for example: people’s names and faces, events from your past, rhymes/stories/sayings your character repeats a lot, skill proficiencies, and languages. At the start of each day make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, strike one of these off at random - you have forgotten it! If you lose a skill proficiency or language you may spend 8 hours reminding yourself and relearning it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Destroying the helm.</em></strong> To destroy the helm, knowledge of it must exist in no mortal’s memory except the one attuned to it. The instant that is achieved, both the helm and its wearer fade into dust, and the wearer’s existence is wiped from the memory of all mortals.</p>

            <p>Whilst attuned to this statue you have three luck points which are regained after you finish a long rest. Whenever you roll a die, you can spend one luck point to roll another die of the same size. You can then choose which of the dice rolls to use. You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll a die, but before the outcome is determined.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the result of the rolled die is a 1, a devil is summoned. Consult the chart below to determine which devil.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Attuner Level</td><td>Devil (CR)</td><td>Reference</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1-4</td><td>Imp (1)</td><td>MM pg.76; SRD pg.277</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5-8</td><td>Barbed (5)</td><td>MM pg.70; SRD pg. 274</td></tr>
                <tr><td>9-12</td><td>Bone (9)</td><td>MM pg.71; SRD pg. 275</td></tr>
                <tr><td>13-16</td><td>Ice (14)</td><td>MM pg.75; SRD pg.277</td></tr>
                <tr><td>17-20</td><td>Pit Fiend (20)</td><td>MM pg.77; SRD pg.278</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p class="indent">The devil is always the same individual who has progressed further in the infernal hierarchy with each visitation. It is hostile towards all creatures, but is especially hateful towards the attuner, whom it believes is stealing its luck.</p>

        <description>
            <p>The nullhelm has 3 charges and regains 1d3 charges daily, at midnight. As a bonus action, you may expend a charge to invoke an effect identical to antimagic field , requiring no components and with a duration of one round. The field lasts until the end of your next turn. Whilst wearing the nullhelm you gain resistance to psychic damage, cannot cast spells, and all magical healing you receive is halved.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nullhelms are one of the few magic items supplied by the Pale Arsenal and permitted to be used by spellbreakers. Based on the legendary Nullhelm of Amneosius, an artifact the Trinity jealously guard, the Pale Arsenal have replicated its effects, albeit to a lesser degree.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This wand has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. It may be used as a spellcasting focus by a Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use the wand to cast a spell, you may expend up to 3 charges to increase the range for that casting. If the spell’s base range is touch, the range becomes a number of feet equal to10 times the number of charges expended. If the base range is 10 feet or less, the spell’s range is increased by 10 feet per charge. If the spell’s base range is over 10 feet, the range is increased by 30 feet per charge.</p>
            <p class="indent">Spells with a range of self are unaffected.</p>
