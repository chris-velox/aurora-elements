            <p>An ornate copper lantern, speckled with a matte, teal tarnish. Small, glowing, turquoise orbs chase one another around the interior of the glass cylinder, the shifting patterns of light mirroring their play.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Faerie Lights.</em></strong> This magical lantern emits a bright, turquoise light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Glitter Bomb.</em></strong> As an action, you can throw this lantern up to 60 feet. The lantern shatters, casting faerie fire (save DC 13) centred on its point of impact and requiring no components, nor concentration. Creatures within 5 feet of its impact have disadvantage on the saving throw made to resist this effect.</p>
