        <description>
            <p>You draw the bones from all corpses within range, forming a carapace of ribcages and femurs. You gain temporary hit points for each Small or larger corpse wholly or partly within range, according to its size:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Corpse Size</td><td>Temporary Hit Points</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>Small</td><td>1d6 + 1</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Medium</td><td>1d8 + 2</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Large</td><td>1d10 + 5</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Huge</td><td>1d12 + 12</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>1d20 + 25</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p class="indent">As an action on a subsequent turn you can cause your armour of bones to erupt, expending all remaining temporary hit points. All creatures within range must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking piercing damage equal to your expended temporary hit points on a failure, or half as much damage on a success. However the temporary hit points are lost, the bones shatter and cannot be used in this way again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the range of this spell increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 5th.</p>

            <p>You warp and distort the memories of a creature within range that you can see, bringing forth hideous, disturbing, mental images. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d10 psychic damage, becomes stunned until the start of your next turn, and you learn something about the creature (roll a d6 and consult the following chart):</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Trait Learnt</td></tr>

                <tr><td>6</td><td>Its saving throw proficiencies</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>On a successful save the creature takes half as much damage, is not stunned, and you learn nothing. A creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or lower automatically succeeds on the saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d10.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of synapseoverloading, neurotoxic, blue-grey fog, centered on a point within range. The fog spreads around corners, lasting for the duration or until it is dispersed by a strong wind. Its area is lightly obscured.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. On a a failure, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage, 3d8 psychic damage, and can not concentrate on spells until the start of its next turn. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage, and normal rules apply to it maintaining concentration. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5th.</p>
