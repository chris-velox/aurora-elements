            <p class="indent">A magical aura makes your impact on your surroundings unseen, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.</p>

As long as concentration is maintained, you can arrange any newly added cubes as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>

If your concentration is broken after 4 cubes of fiendfyre are active, the spell doesn't end and rages out of control. The fiendfyre will continue to double at the beginning of each round, until the end of its duration. If you decide to end the spell while you still have concentration, the spell ends as normal and all fiendfyre disappears.</p>
            <p class="indent">The fiendfyre damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. Even magical objects and defenses are damaged or destroyed by this spell.</p>

            <p class="indent">The Confundus Charm is a particularly powerful charm that leaves anything confused, forgetful, and impressionable, often causing people to wander off absent-mindedly. If the target is an object that operates or functions on its own, it will operate erratically, malfunction, or completely shut down. This spell has no effect on a completely inanimate objects that entirely depend on external manipulation.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the target is a creature you choose within range, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target can’t take reactions and, if not distracted with something, you roll a d10. If you roll 1-8, the creature must use all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, assign a direction to each number 1-8. If you roll a 9-10, the creature doesn't move. Whether it moves or not, the creature doesn’t take an action this turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">If desired, you can suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) at the time of casting and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to directly hurt itself or its allies will have no effect. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a wizard hug the next blast-ended skrewt he sees. If the condition isn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell's effects end for that target.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional target for each slot level above 4th. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.</p>

            <p class="flavor">The Dragon-Making Spell</p>
            <p class="indent">A particularly intimidating display of transfiguration, this spell turns a desk-sized object into a miniature version of an adult dragon. Choose either one or two inanimate, nonmagical objects that each fill a 5-foot cube within range and choose one of the following options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One dragon wyrmling of challenge rating 4 or lower</li>
                <li>Two dragon wyrmlings of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">The object becomes a Medium-sized dragon construct with the chosen wyrmling's statistics, which is untransfigured when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">The dragon construct is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the dragon construct, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your concentration is broken, the dragon construct doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the construct, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled dragon construct can't be dismissed by you, and it untransfigures 10 minutes after you transfigured it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The HM has the creature's statistics.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level, choose one of the following options:</p>

                <li>Three dragon wyrmlings of challenge rating 2 or lower</li>

            <p class="flavor">The Bubble Spell</p>
            <p class="indent">You conjure up a swirling sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell’s duration.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any creature in the sphere’s space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature’s choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the swirling bubble of water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.</p>

            <p class="flavor">The Engorgement Charm</p>
            <p class="indent">You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's items and equipment also grow to match its new size. While enlarged, the target deals 1d4 extra damage.</p>

            <p class="flavor">The Patronus Charm</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Tags:</b> Defensive</p>
            <p class="indent">A Patronus Charm is a special bit of magic that requires a wizard to envision one of their happiest memories while casting the spell. The feeling of happiness must be genuine or strong enough to produce a radiant, ethereal beast, the embodiment of that wizard's positive emotions that serves as their protector.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast this spell, you can choose to conjure an incorporeal or corporeal patronus. If you attempt to cast this spell while frightened or within 60 feet of a dementor, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the number of dementors within 60 feet of you. A roll of 19-20 on the die automatically succeeds.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">Highly Advanced Magic</h5>
                <p>Part of the reason the Patronus Charm is regarded as a difficult spell is because the caster must relive a truly joyful memory when casting. This spell's ability check is unusual, but represents the unique challenge of focusing on suitable memory in a stressful situation.</p>
                <p class="indent">Remember that a frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks, including this one. Your GM can allow you to spend Inspiration to automatically succeed on this check. Your character might bring forth a powerful childhood memory in their time of need.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent">On a success, you cast the spell. On a failure, you can only conjure an incorporeal patronus, but if you fail the check by 5 or more, the spell fails entirely.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of your turn, if you are frightened or there are one or more dementors within 60 feet of you while concentrating on this spell, you must repeat the ability check. On a failure, your patronus vanishes and the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">A patronus sheds light in a radius around it. You and friendly creatures can't be frightened while in your patronus's light. A dementor that starts its turn within this light or enters the light for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the patronus until the start of its next turn (this fear ignores any immunity to the frightened condition). While frightened, the dementor must take the Dash action on its turn and move away from the patronus by the safest available route until it leaves the light.</p>
            <p class="indent">Incorporeal Patronus. Your patronus takes the form of a 5-foot burst of glowing mist in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. The patronus doesn't fill its space. It sheds bright light in its space and dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p>
            <p class="indent">On subsequent turns, you can move the patronus to another space adjacent to you as a bonus action. Additionally, you can move it as a reaction to a dementor moving within 10 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Corporeal Patronus. Your patronus takes the form of a wispy silver animal in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The patronus doesn't fill its space. It has no hit points and is immune to all damage, but can be targeted by another spell that affects magic, such as finite incantatem. The patronus sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the patronus. The distance you can move it depends on the size of the patronus. A Medium or smaller patronus can move 60 feet, a Large patronus can move 45 feet, and a Huge patronus can move 30 feet. A patronus ignores objects and terrain. In addition, the Patronus can enter a creature's space and stop there.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">More than Dementors</h5>
                <p>The Patronus Charm is most famous for its use against dementors, but a patronus can be a potent protector against other dark and dangerous creatures in the Wizarding World.</p>
                <p class="indent">Only dementors and lethifolds have been confirmed to be affected by a patronus. At the GM's discretion, your patronus can interact with or harm creatures like banshees, inferi, or obscuri. If your GM decides a creature can be affected by a patronus, the creature is susceptible to the patronus's fear effect and can be attacked and take damage from it.</p>
                <p class="indent">Even if a patronus is unable to harm a particular kind of creature, its soothing presence can still protect you by preventing fear.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent">At any time during the patronus's movement, you can direct the patronus to charge into a dementor within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the patronus using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 radiant damage and the patronus pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The patronus moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it and does not use any movement to do so.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the radius of the dim light increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p class="flavor">The Disarming Charm</p>
            <p class="indent">Famous for being the spell that finally defeated Voldemort in the Second Wizarding War, this spell can harmlessly end duels by disarming a wizard of his wand. Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, you disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. The object lands 10 feet away from it in a random direction.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can choose the direction the object travels and the object's distance increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

            <p class="flavor">The Concussive Curse</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell shoots out from your wand and a wave of thunderous force sweeps out from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from that point. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from that point by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 100 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p class="indent">When cast upon a single dwelling that fits within range, it becomes a secret, infallibly invisible and inaccessible by anyone else. This effect reaches to the dwelling's property lines, or if no property lines are defined, the edge of the hemisphere centered on the caster at the time of casting.</p>
            <p class="indent">You choose yourself or one person within the area of the spell to be the Secret-Keeper. If the Secret-Keeper tells someone the secret (the location of the dwelling) verbally or in writing, that person can see the secret like the Secret-Keeper and step onto the property. It's impossible for anyone other than the Secret-Keeper to share the secret. If the Secret-Keeper dies, everyone who knows the secret becomes Secret-Keepers and can share the secret with others.</p>
            <p class="indent">Three dimensional space is warped around the secret, as if the space occupied by the secret never existed. If a person walks directly towards the secret, they will magically appear on the other side. Nothing will remain that indicates or gives clues to the existence of the secret. If anyone knew the location of the secret before the spell is cast, they forget the exact address but remember the general area where the secret is located.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell is completely undetectable and the area can't be targeted by divination spells. The spell's effects will only end if you dispel it or all Secret-Keepers have died.</p>

On a success, it perceives subtle flaws and understands it to be a fake. 5 days after casting this spell, the duplicate begins to show significant signs of degradation, granting advantage on the Investigation check. If specialis revelio is cast on the duplicate, the caster is made aware that the object is a duplicate created by this spell.</p>

            <p class="indent">While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it. You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.</p>

After the spell effects begin, eye contact does not need to be maintained.</p>
            <p class="indent">You initially learn the surface thoughts of the being - what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can attempt to probe deeper into its mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. You can probe deeper a second time, forcefully pulling memories from the being's mind if it fails the second Wisdom saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">Questions verbally directed at the target naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. If you cast the spell verbally and the target can hear you, it knows you are probing into its mind and the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check. If it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>

This spell always is cast with the effects of the Subtle Spell metamagic, at no sorcery point cost and whether you have Subtle Spell or not.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 3d10 psychic damage and be restrained. Additionally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b>Tags:</b> School of Magic - Charms</p>
            <p class="indent">You attempt to reshape another being's memories. One being that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event or detail that it experienced or perceived within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event or detail, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p>
            <p class="indent">You must mentally describe or visualize how the memories are affected. The being's mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing or visualizing the modified memories, the target’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a being behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much it enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The HM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a being in a significant manner.</p>
            <p class="indent">A vulnera sanentur or obliviate spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level). Alternatively, you can alter a detail or topic in all memories across those same time frames.</p>

            <p class="indent">Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to five nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as one object, Large targets count as two objects, Huge targets count as four objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

            <p class="indent">An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determine by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet, if the Objects lack legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determine by its size. The HM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate one additional object for each slot level above 5th.</p>

You enchant an area to suggest a course of activity and magically influence a non-magical human. Upon entering the warded area, the subject must make a Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage.

            <p class="indent">You set a mental alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, a ping in your mind alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area, if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm.</p>

            <p class="flavor">The Regenerating Spell</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Tags:</b> School of Magic - Healing</p>
            <p class="indent">Tracing your wand over a being's wounds, you weave a complex counter-curse that undoes the damage dealt to a being. The target regains four times your spellcasting ability modifier + 4d8 hit points instantaneously, and then 4d4 hit points for every following turn for the duration of the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the target has lost body members (fingers, legs, and so on) and the severed part is held to its place throughout the entire duration of the spell, the spell causes the limb to heal back on after 1 minute of casting.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the instantaneous healing increases by 1d8 and the subsequent healing increases by 3d4 for each slot level above 6th.</p>

            <p class="flavor">The Levitation Charm</p>
            <p class="indent">One creature other than yourself or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 100 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the spell is ended voluntarily, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft. If ended involuntarily, the target immediately drops.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the weight limit is increased by 150 pounds for each slot level above 0.</p>
