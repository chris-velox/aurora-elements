        <description>
            <p>Charms, a type of spell that alters properties of a thing, can be some of the most powerful spells in existence. The Fidelius Charm, for example, can completely hide a person or a place in such a way that no one can find them unless given the Secret. Memory Charms can be so strong as to remove a person's memory or damage their mind permanently.</p>
            <h4>DUELISTS</h4>
            <p>Many charms have been weaponized for magical combat. A wizard's duel is a formal practice in wizarding culture in which wizards or witches faced each other and, at the count of three, attempted to disarm, stun, injure, defeat, or kill each other in order to force submission. A duelist is a master of this art, competing in organized, refereed, and non-lethal duels to test and hone their skills.</p>
            <h4>ENCHANTERS</h4>
            <p>Other wizards try their hand at enchantments, a nearly permanent charm placed on an inanimate object. These bewitched objects can range from handy (like a self-stirring coffee mug), to complex (like a top-tier racing broom), to bizarre (like a book acting like a rabid version of its subject matter). An enchanted or bewitched object can be powerful in the hands of the right wizard.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Formally referred to as Dark charms, jinxes, hexes and curses are often associated with the Dark Arts because they inflict malicious effects on the target. While jinxes are mostly irritating and hexes are a little worse or more painful, curses are the worst kind of Dark magic. All three Unforgivables are classified as curses, and the average civilian wizard could go their whole life without casting a serious curse.</p>
            <h4>AURORS</h4>
            <p>Curses are mainstays in the arsenals of Aurors, highly-trained specialist officers tasked with upholding the law and protecting their magical communities from large-scale threats. To be successful, an Auror must be capable across a variety of skills, like curses, counter-spells, transfiguration, poisons, antidotes, concealment, disguise, and tracking.</p>
            <h4>CURSE-BREAKERS</h4>
            <p>On the other end of the spectrum, a curse-breaker removes, counters or breaks curses placed on objects or places for a living. Whilst curse-breakers could work for the Ministry of Magic, the term is also used to denote a number of adventurous bankers employed by Gringotts Wizarding Bank, tasked with disabling and countering curses in ancient tombs or historical sites to bring back gold and treasure.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Transfiguration is a branch of magic that focuses on the alteration of the form or appearance of an object, via the manipulation of the object's molecular structure. Transfiguration is regarded as “very hard work” and is “more scientific” than any other form of magic, i.e. the practicing witch or wizard has to get it exactly right for the transfiguration to be successful.</p>
            <h4>ANIMAGI</h4>
            <p>The most legendary practitioner of transfiguration is an Animagus, a witch or wizard who can self-transfigure into an animal at will. It takes skill, practice, and patience for wizards and witches to become Animagi. The process is long and arduous, and has the potential to backfire and cause the transformation to go horribly wrong. As a result, there are very few Animagi, and the power they possess requires registration with the Ministry of Magic.</p>
            <h4>ALCHEMISTS</h4>
            <p>A far less known application of transfiguration is Alchemy, the branch of magic and an ancient science concerned with the study of the structure, composition, and magical properties of the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, and water), as well as the transmutation of substances. Intimately connected with potion-making, chemistry and transfiguration, there are many who hold it to be the most difficult magic.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Your animagus form is the beast that is your corporeal patronus, with a CR 1 statblock. If you have not discovered your corporeal patronus form yet, use Appendix B: Patronus Rolling Tables. As an animagus, you cannot transform into a magical beast. If you roll a magical beast as your patronus form (roll 1 and 12 on the Patronus Rolling Tables), you must re-roll your patronus animal.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can stay in animagus form for a number of hours equal to half your transfiguration level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
                <p class="indent">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you, use the higher bonus.</li>
                    <li>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and hit dice. When you revert, you return to the hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animagus form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.</li>
                    <li>You can't cast spells, and the actions you can take are dependent on your beast form's physical capabilities. Transforming doesn't break your concentration or prevent actions that are part of an already-cast spell.</li>
                    <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.</li>
                    <li>Your equipment merges into your new form and has no effect until you leave the form.</li>

        <description>
            <p>Healing magic is devoted to improving the physical and mental condition. With many different spells and potions, healing magic requires a wizard to be well-versed in magical conditions and their different remedies.</p>
            <h4>HEALERS</h4>
            <p>A healer is the wizarding world equivalent of a Muggle doctor. They tend to the sick and injured, often finding employment in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, England's primary wizarding hospital. Healers may find themselves facing artifact accidents, Dark creature bites, magical diseases, potion poisoning, or spell damage.</p>
            <h4>MEDIWIZARDS</h4>
            <p>A mediwizard takes a much more active role in preserving life; if a healer is a doctor, then a mediwizard is a first responder. Mediwitches travel with research expeditions, watch over professional Quidditch, accompany monster hunters, and dive into war to save lives.</p>

            <p>Divination is an unusual branch of magic involving gathering insights into past, present and future events. It is an inexact science, requiring interpretation of tea leaves and omens. Some believe true divination involves meditation and a belief of non-self to access the Inner Eye, while Centaurs have a unique way of practicing divination by observing the movement of planets, moons, and stars.</p>
            <h4>SEERS</h4>
            <p>Naturally gifted in divination, a seer is a wizard or witch who can see into the future with their Inner Eye. While some seers unknowingly utter prophecies about strangers, other seers will glimpse their own futures. Albus Dumbledore believed that seeing into the future is incredibly difficult, because the complexity of every action and its consequences.</p>
            <h4>LEGILIMENS</h4>
            <p>Legilimency is a far more tangible ability, navigating through the many layers of a person's mind and interpreting one's findings. Muggles call this “mind-reading,” but practitioners disdain the term as naive. They often practice occlumency, shielding your mind from the invasion of another legilimens. Although rare natural legilimens exist, it is a field of study that requires great dedication and care.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Magizoologists study magical creatures. As they work with many different creatures, the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures at the Ministry of Magic created a classification of every known beast, being and spirit, ranging from X to XXXXX. Whether harmless or an untameable wizard-killer, magizoologists record the unique traits of beasts for wizardkind’s safety.</p>
            <h4>DRAGON-KEEPERS</h4>
            <p>Dragon-keepers call the dragon reserve home, caring for the most famous XXXXX classified creature among wizards and Muggles alike. Spending day after day with them, dragon-keepers often learn to see through the eyes of their ward and empathize with the plight of many magical beasts. They seek to understand dragons for the benefit of all.</p>
            <h4>MONSTER HUNTERS</h4>
            <p>Alternatively, some take a confrontational style of protection. When a wizarding village is plagued by a growing community of trolls, or they suspect a vampire is the cause of their dead livestock, they turn to a monster hunter. Dark creatures blur into the magical being category, so a monster hunter must deal with intelligent demi-humans just as well as corral a stray beast. It is up to the monster hunter to approach a situation wand blazing or seeking a peaceful resolution.</p>

                <p>In learning to combat dangerous targets, you know how to place a magical trap, waiting to be sprung. Instead of casting a spell that targets a single creature or an area, you can weave that spell into your surroundings, having no immediate effect and casting that spell when triggered. You decide what triggers the spell at the time of setting the trap, such as entering an area, getting within a certain distance, or manipulating an object. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the spell, such as specific people or those who say a certain password.</p>
                <p class="indent">Only one creature can be targeted by the spell, and the area of effect is centered on the triggering creature. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts its full duration. A trap can be detected by a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, or by casting specialis revelio.</p>

                <p><h5>BONDING WITH YOUR BEAST</h5></p>
                <p>With 8 hours of uninterrupted communication and bonding, you can call upon a non-hostile beast to serve as your faithful companion. When you gain this feature, select your companion from any Small or larger single beast of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. You can have only one beast companion at a time.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your beast companion obeys your commands as best it can. The beast moves and acts during your turn, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. You and your companion can move and act in any order you choose. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your companion will fight in unison with you. The following rules apply while it is bonded to you by this feature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It can't use its natural attack actions, but it can make unarmed strikes. Its damage die for unarmed strikes becomes a d4.</li>
                    <li>It is proficient in two saving throws and two skills of your choice, in addition to its normal proficiencies.</li>
                    <li>It uses your proficiency bonus for attacks, as well as for saving throws and skills in which it is proficient.</li>
                    <li>It adds your proficiency bonus to its armor class.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">For each of your levels above 6th, your companion gains a hit die and its maximum hit points increase by an amount equal to its Constitution modifier plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 0). Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement, you can also allocate two points among your companion's ability scores. If your beast companion is ever slain or dismissed, a bond may be formed with another beast and that beast will progress according to your current level.</p>
                <h5>COMMANDING YOUR BEAST</h5>
                <p>You train your companion to follow certain commands. You have a number of Command Dice equal to half your level (rounded down) + your Wisdom modifier. A command die is a d6, and it is used to issue specifically trained commands to beasts, including your beast companion.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can issue one command at a time to a beast within 120 feet of you that can hear you; the beast must be able to hear you to follow the command, and the command is wasted if the beast doesn't fulfill it before the end of its next turn. When a command die is rolled, its use is expended. Your command die becomes a d8 when you reach 14th level.</p>
                <p class="indent">You regain all command dice when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5 class="caption">Beast Commands</h5>
                <p class="indent">Your companion knows two beast commands of your choice. It learns an additional command when you reach 14th level. You can also teach any friendly beast other than your companion only one beast command by spending at least 1 hour per day for 7 days training the creature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Attack. You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion can use its action to take one of its natural attack actions. However, it can't use its Multiattack action, if it has one. If the attack hits, add the result of the command die to the damage roll.</p>
                <p class="indent">Down. You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion uses its reaction to fall prone and attempt to Hide, adding the result of the command die to its Dexterity (Stealth) check. The first attack it makes while hidden in this way also adds the result of the command die to its attack roll.</p>
                <p class="indent">Find. You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion uses its reaction to attempt to Search for hidden creatures or objects, adding the result of the command die to the skill check made for the Search.</p>
                <p class="indent">Grab. When your companion makes an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction and roll a command die to issue this command. If the attack hits, your companion can attempt to grapple the target as part of the attack, adding the result of the command die to the skill check it makes for the attempt.</p>
                <p class="indent">Rush. You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion uses its reaction to take the Help action, aiding the next attack against a creature within its reach that it can see. If this attack hits, the attack deals extra damage equal to the result of the command die.</p>
