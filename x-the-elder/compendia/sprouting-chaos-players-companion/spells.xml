            <p>You transform one of your arms into an extendable vine whose end sticks to any surface that it touches. The arm cannot be used to wield any objects or weapons. On every turn within the duration, including the turn that you cast the spell, you can make either of the following actions:</p>
            <p class="indent">Grab Creature. As a bonus action, you extend your vine arm forward, attempting to pull one creature you choose within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pulled 10 feet directly towards you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Grab Surface. As a bonus action, you extend your vine arm forward, pulling yourself to a hard surface such as a wall or ceiling within 20 feet of you. If this movement would cause you to be suspended off the ground, you remain so until you take an action or the concentration ends.</p>

            <p>Choose one creature you can see within range. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving throw or become connected to you with a magical vine. A Huge or smaller creature that you are connected with must make a Strength saving throw whenever they attempt to move to a point more than 20 feet away from you. A Huge creature makes this save with advantage. On a failed save, their speed is reduced to zero until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, the vine snaps, and they are freed.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You cause large branches to sprout from a surface, creating a makeshift bridge up to 20 feet in length. The bridge can hold up to 600 pounds at once. The bridge has AC 10 and 50 hit points. If the bridge is reduced to zero hit points, the entire bridge collapses and immediately withers away.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the bridge’s length increases by 10 feet, its weight limit increases by 100 pounds, and its hit points increase by 25 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You conjure a 10-foot radius cloud of hallucination spores centered on a point you can see within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind disperses it, ending the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and becomes poisoned until the start of their next turn. A poisoned target is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 while it hallucinates. On a successful save, a creature instead takes half damage and suffers no other effect. Creatures are affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You summon plant creatures that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. You choose one the following options for what appears:</p>

            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level Spell Slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear - twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.</p>

At the start of each of your turns, the length of the line increases by 5 feet in the same direction. For the duration, these vines turn the ground in that area to difficult terrain.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 piercing damage and be restrained by the vines until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by the vines takes 2d6 piercing damage and is pulled 5 feet in the direction that the vines are growing.</p>
            <p class="indent">A creature restrained by the vines can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.</p>

Once discovered, it can be removed with anything that removes a disease.</p>
            <p class="indent">At first, the spore has no effect on the target. However, it slowly grows over time, infecting the target’s brain and eventually giving you control over them. The effects are listed below in the order they are given:</p>
            <p class="indent">After 10 days. You always know the general location of the infected creature as long as you are on the same plane of existence, though you do not know any specific information about that location.</p>
            <p class="indent">After 30 days. As a bonus action, you can read the infected creature’s surface thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its current emotions and what it is actively thinking about) as long as you are on the same plane of existence. If you perform a 1 hour ritual, you instead gain access to any of that creature’s thoughts since your initial casting of the spell. If the spell is dispelled at this point, the creature takes 5d10 psychic damage, as the spore has partially melded with their brain.</p>
            <p class="indent">After 1 year. You gain the ability to cast suggestion on the infected creature, without expending a spell slot or material components, as long as you are on the same plane of existence. The creature automatically fails the saving throw. If the spell is dispelled at this point, the creature takes 10d10 psychic damage, as the spore has near completely melded with their brain.</p>

                <li>Cause the plant to shape itself into a form you designate. The plant’s branches and leaves may twist into words, create images, or shape into patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>If the plant you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the plant to Become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour.</li>

            <p>You cause a thick branch to shoot out of the ground along a line 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be pushed along the length of the branch as it grows in a direction of your choice. If the branch impacts a hard surface, such as a wall, it immediately stops and skewers all creatures that were pushed against that wall. Each creature takes 3d4 piercing damage and is restrained, skewered to the surface. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice) against the spell’s saving throw DC. On a failed save, a creature takes an additional 2d4 piercing damage. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained.</p>
