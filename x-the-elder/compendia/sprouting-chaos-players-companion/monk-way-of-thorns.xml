            <p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the power of nature. Nature has become an extension of yourself, and you have learned to use it to great effect. By following this Way, you learn techniques to manipulate plants, allowing them to bend to your will and aid you both in combat and out of it.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical disciplines that harness the power of nature. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</p>
                <p class="indent">You know the Natural Attunement discipline and one other nature discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the "Nature Disciplines" section below. You learn one additional nature discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th.and 17th level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you learn a new nature discipline, you can also replace one nature discipline that you already know with a different discipline.</p>
                <p class="indent">Casting Nature Spells. Some nature disciplines allow you to cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don’t need to provide material components for it.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki points to increase the level of a nature discipline spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level, as slicing leaves does. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional ki point you spend. For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Nature’s Weapon to cast <em>slicing leaves</em>, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p>
                <p class="indent">The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way(including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p>
