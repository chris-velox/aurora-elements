            <p>The Seedmaster archetype serves as an alternate path to the Beastmaster archetype, instead growing a bond between a small plant creature and the ranger. The ranger and the plant work as one to fight off forces of evil and destruction. Seedmaster rangers lovingly cultivate their magic seedlings, forming an almost pet-like bond between themselves and the animated plant.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and a small seedling. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. At the conclusion of this ritual, the seedling gains magical abilities that you can activate.</p>
                <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you may throw the seedling up to 30 feet, which then roots itself into the ground where it lands. The seedling’s size when deployed is Small, and it has 8 Strength, 14 Dexterity, 10 Constitution, 5 Wisdom, 3 Intelligence, and 1 Charisma. It has 10 + your proficiency bonus AC and hit points equal to 8 + double your ranger level, and cannot move until you safely unroot it using a 1 minute ritual. If the seedling is reduced to 0 hit points, it withers back into a small seed which cannot be deployed again until you complete a short rest. Once the seedling is planted, you can give it the following commands:</p>
                <p class="indent">Thorn Strike. As a bonus action, you can command the seedling to shoot a thorn at an enemy within 20 feet of it that you can see. Make a ranged spell attack against that enemy using your Ranger spell attack bonus. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">This damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>
                <p class="indent">Trip Attack. When a Large or smaller creature that you can see moves within 5 feet of the seedling, you may use your reaction to command the seedling to trip that creature. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Ranger spell save DC or fall prone.</p>
