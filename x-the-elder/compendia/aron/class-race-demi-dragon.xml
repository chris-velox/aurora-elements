        <description>
            <p class="indent">Each demi-dragon is different, with some drawing heavily upon the essence of true dragons, while others defy such comparisons. Many demi-dragons are ostracized by those around them, but a few are celebrated. Some relish their new form, while others loathe what has been done to them, but all are linked by the circumstances surrounding their transformation.</p>
            <h4>IMITATION OF FORM</h4>
            <p>To most, dragons are a thing to be feared and hated. But to a few, dragons are envied as paragons of power. Among these, there are some who would sacrifice anything if it would let them have that power for their own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether driven by fanatical beliefs, a hunger for personal power, or a genuine wish to help others by whatever means are available, some choose to undergo a ritual transformation that changes their body into an imitation of a true dragon, while other individuals concoct detailed magical experiments on unwilling subjects. Regardless of origin, the resulting creature is known as a demi-dragon—a being that was created rather than born.</p>
            <h4>RITUAL TRANSFORMATION</h4>
            <p>The exact nature of the demi-dragon transformation is unclear, but some say that there are multiple paths to the same result. Whether accomplished through magical prowess, alchemy, zealous devotion, or by bathing in dragon's blood, the transformation draws upon the essence of a true dragon to instill a spark of magic within the subject, forcing them to take on the characteristics of a dragon. Though adopting the shape of a dragon during the transformation, the subject is often brought only halfway there, and can be left temporarily scaleless or wingless. Such deficiencies tend to correct themselves over time.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once transformed, it is commonly believed that there is no conventional way to revert the transformation—only the most powerful of magic could accomplish such a thing.</p>
            <h4>SPARK OF MAGIC</h4>
            <p>As part of their transformation, a spark of magic forms in the heart of a demi-dragon—this is what allows them to mimic a dragon's power and imitate their elemental breath weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a result of their unusual nature, demi-dragons develop the ability to siphon magic out of their surroundings, requiring an external source of magical energy to feed this spark as a way to bring themselves closer to the inherent nature of true dragons. The relative power of this spark is a measure of the magical essence a demi-dragon has accumulated. While demi-dragons need not devour magic for sustenance, they are seized by a growing hunger to do so the longer they go without.</p>
            <p class="indent">Where true dragons are born into their natural splendor, demi-dragons must toil, steal, and sacrifice for but a fraction of that power.</p>
            <h4>Demi-Dragon Traits</h4>
            <p>Your draconic nature manifests in a variety of shared traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dragon blood can expand the lifespan of a creature. A demi-dragon can live for roughly four hundred years, starting from when they were first transformed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Demi-dragons have a body mass that is identical to that of their previous form. At most, a demi-dragon stands 4 feet tall from shoulder to the ground, and measures no longer than 16 feet from snout to tail tip, of which their body accounts for a maximum of 5 feet. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Type.</em></strong> Your creature type is dragon, rather than humanoid.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Aided Jump.</em></strong> Your wings provide you with lift. Your maximum jump distance for high and long jumps is doubled, and is unaffected by whether or not you take a running start. This extra distance costs movement as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Dragon Scales.</em></strong> Your magical essence enhances your protective scales. While you aren't wearing armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Constitution modifier + your Charisma modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Mythic Build.</em></strong> You count as one size category larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your claws have enough manual dexterity to manipulate objects as normal, but you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons, and receive no benefit from wielding shields. In order to wear armor, you must have it specially constructed for you, costing three times the normal rate.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Weapons.</em></strong> You have access to an arsenal of natural weapons. You can use these natural weapons, with which you are proficient, to make melee weapon attacks. Your fanged maw deals piercing damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier on a hit. Your lashing tail has a reach of 10 feet and deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d10 + your Strength modifier. Your rending claws deal slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. When you take the Attack action and attack with your claw, you can use your bonus action to make an additional claw attack.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Inheritance.</em></strong> Your connection to a particular type of dragon manifests as an interest in a specific subject. You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, Acrobatics, Deception, History, and Persuasion.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Draconic, and one other language of your choice.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A single crimson-scaled runt of a dragon stands trapped amidst an orcish warband, waving their axes in anticipation of an easy kill. With a roar, fire lights up the forest clearing as she charges fearlessly, driving the startled orcs back with a ferocity that belies her modest size.</p>
            <p class="indent">The azure dragon studies the wizard's arcane runes, his companions waiting close by. Jotting a note down in his beloved journal, he inhales deeply, leeching the magical energy right out of the protective ward. With a satisfied smirk, he leads his companions deeper into the wizard's sanctum.</p>
            <p class="indent">Within a stone temple upon an icy mountaintop, the dragon sage sits in meditation. He was content to weather the blizzard that would soon leave him stranded and isolated, warmed only by the soft glow of the smoldering sphere of fire which he held aloft in supplication. He relished the chance to reflect upon the events of his journey.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though each of these demi-dragons tell a different story, they share a similar background—they were once humanoids who underwent a metamorphic transformation that changed their body. Those that are so afflicted are rare, but each must learn to live with the consequences in their own way.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each demi-dragon is different, with some drawing heavily upon the essence of true dragons, while others defy such comparisons. Many demi-dragons are ostracized by those around them, but a few are celebrated. Some relish their new form, while others loathe what has been done to them, but all are linked by the circumstances surrounding their transformation.</p>
            <h4>IMITATION OF FORM</h4>
            <p>To most, dragons are a thing to be feared and hated. But to a few, dragons are envied as paragons of power. Among these, there are some who would sacrifice anything if it would let them have that power for their own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether driven by fanatical beliefs, a hunger for personal power, or a genuine wish to help others by whatever means are available, some choose to undergo a ritual transformation that changes their body into an imitation of a true dragon, while other individuals concoct detailed magical experiments on unwilling subjects. Regardless of origin, the resulting creature is known as a demi-dragon—a being that was created rather than born.</p>
            <h4>RITUAL TRANSFORMATION</h4>
            <p>The exact nature of the demi-dragon transformation is unclear, but some say that there are multiple paths to the same result. Whether accomplished through magical prowess, alchemy, zealous devotion, or by bathing in dragon's blood, the transformation draws upon the essence of a true dragon to instill a spark of magic within the subject, forcing them to take on the characteristics of a dragon. Though adopting the shape of a dragon during the transformation, the subject is often brought only halfway there, and can be left temporarily scaleless or wingless. Such deficiencies tend to correct themselves over time.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once transformed, it is commonly believed that there is no conventional way to revert the transformation—only the most powerful of magic could accomplish such a thing.</p>
            <h4>SPARK OF MAGIC</h4>
            <p>As part of their transformation, a spark of magic forms in the heart of a demi-dragon—this is what allows them to mimic a dragon's power and imitate their elemental breath weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a result of their unusual nature, demi-dragons develop the ability to siphon magic out of their surroundings, requiring an external source of magical energy to feed this spark as a way to bring themselves closer to the inherent nature of true dragons. The relative power of this spark is a measure of the magical essence a demi-dragon has accumulated. While demi-dragons need not devour magic for sustenance, they are seized by a growing hunger to do so the longer they go without.</p>
            <p class="indent">Where true dragons are born into their natural splendor, demi-dragons must toil, steal, and sacrifice for but a fraction of that power.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A DEMI-DRAGON</h4>
            <p>When creating your demi-dragon, you should carefully consider two questions: who were you before you became a demi-dragon, and what series of events led you to end up as one? Perhaps the transformation was forced upon you, or maybe it is part of a local tradition. Consider carefully what your character was like before, how others see them, and how they see themselves now.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a demi-dragon quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score, followed by Constitution and Charisma. Second, choose the Victim of Thaumaturgy background. Last, choose a cone of fire for your Dragon's Breath feature.</p>

                <h5 class="caption">Consequences of Transformation</h5>
                <p>You have undergone a ritual that has changed the nature of your being. You lose all racial traits associated with your former race and instead adopt those of the demi-dragon. You keep your memories, alignment, and other class levels (if any). You can't use the demi-dragon racial traits if you don't have at least one level of the class.</p>
                <p class="indent">The size of your new body will slowly increase as you gain levels, but your size remains Medium. If your previous race was Small, your size increases to Medium, but you are left emaciated and suffer from three levels of exhaustion which can be cured only by eating sufficiently and finishing long rests.</p>
                <p class="indent">If your race is later changed by another effect, you lose access to all demi-dragon class features. Your race and class are invariably tied together.</p>

                <p class="indent">Your wings have matured enough to slow your fall. As a reaction to falling while you aren't prone, you can spread your wings and glide, slowing your rate of descent to 20 feet per round. While gliding, you can move up to 40 feet in any horizontal direction, or dive straight down. When you land, you take no falling damage and can land on your feet. Alternatively, you can initiate gliding by expending at least 10 feet of movement as part of a high jump.</p>
                <p class="indent">The speed at which you can glide increases as you gain demi-dragon levels, as shown in the Glide &amp; Fly Speed column of the Demi-Dragon table.</p>

                    <p><b><i>High Jumps (PHB 182).</i></b> When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Using Different Speeds (PHB 190).</i></b> If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Flying Movement (PHB 191).</i></b> Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.</p>

                <p class="indent">You gain the ability to absorb the magical enchantment of a weapon or piece of equipment. This grants you access to the magical powers provided by that item, and removes it from the item. The stolen magic harmlessly flows through your veins. You can absorb an enchantment from a magical item as part of a long rest, during which the item must be in your possession. Once absorbed, you can use the item's magical properties as if you were wearing or wielding the item. The stolen magical power follows all rules that would normally apply to it.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can return the enchantment to the original item as part of a long rest, during which you must have it in your possession. You can't  return the enchantment to a different itemfrom the original item.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can have a maximum of 5 such enchantments active at any one time. If the item requires attunement to use, it  follows normal attunement rules, and you count as being attuned while the enchantment remains absorbed by you. You can't absorb an item's magic  if doing so would cause you to be attuned to more than three items.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can't absorb the power of shields or artifacts. Additionally, the Dungeon Master may rule that a specific item's enchantment can't be absorbed.</p>
                <p class="indent">Only enchantments on items that are designed to be equipment (worn or wielded) may be absorbed. You can't combine these  enchantments in any way that would not normally  be possible—you can't, for instance, benefit from more than one weapon enchantment when making an attack, but if multiple such enchantments are available to you, you can decide which one to use each time you make an attack.</p>
                <p class="indent">Should a cursed item be absorbed, the curse functions as normal. You can rid yourself of the curse after fulfilling its requirements, such as by using the remove curse spell. Doing so temporarily allows you to return the cursed enchantment to its item as part of a long rest.</p>

            <p>Scions are demi-dragons who commit themselves fully to dragonkind. They seek to become indistinguishable from true dragons, hoping to inherit the strength of dragons through purity of blood. To this end, Scions dedicate themselves to a specific draconic bloodline from which they draw their power.</p>

If you gain a swimming speed, it is equal to your walking speed and you can breathe both air and water. If you gain a burrow speed, it is equal to half your walking speed and you can tunnel through loose dirt, gravel, and similar materials, but not through solid materials. If you burrow at half speed, you can reinforce your tunnel as you move, allowing others to safely pass through—otherwise it slowly collapses behind you.</p>

                <p class="indent">You begin to tap into your innate dragon magic and gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Arbiter Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</i></b> You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration, evocation, and transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Arbiter Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration, evocation, or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration, transmutation, or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorceror spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Focus.</i></b> You can use your own body as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. You still need a free hand to use your body as a spellcasting focus in this way.</p>

                <p class="indent">You gain the ability to mystically bind spells to your scales. Doing so takes 1 minute, during which you expend a spell slot to imbue the desired spell. While the spell remains bound, you can cast the spell as a reaction at any time. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration and doesn't take up your concentration. Once cast with a reaction, Scale Bind ends.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, you can rip loose the scale upon which the spell is bound and throw it up to 30 feet. The binding remains intact unless the scale itself is destroyed, and can be triggered with a reaction as normal as long as the scale is within range of a valid target of the bound spell. You don't need to have sight of the triggering target.</p>
                <p class="indent">While the spell remains bound, the scale bears a glowing runic sigil and appears as obviously magical. The spell remains bound for up to 8 hours if not triggered, after which the effect dissipates. You can only bind spells that normally take an action, reaction, or bonus action to cast, and which are of a spell level which your Arbiter level allows you to cast.</p>

                <p class="indent"><b>Active Morph.</b> As part of a short or long rest, you undergo a morph that provides you with new features. This morph lasts indefinitely, or until you choose to change it again. The morph you choose becomes your Active morph, granting you one of its listed named features (your choice).</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Waning Morph.</b> When you change your Active morph to a different morph, the morph chosen for your previously Active morph becomes "Waning". You keep the benefits of the morph, but you are one step closer to forfeiting it. When you change your Active morph again, the effect of the previously Waning morph is lost, and the previously Active morph becomes Waning. In this manner, you are always gaining and discarding new effects.</p>

                <p><b>Chameleon Scales.</b> Your scales gain the ability to change color, letting you blend in with your surroundings. You can take the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. You have advantage on Stealth checks made to hide in dim light and in natural terrain, such as rocks, plants, or sand.</p>

                <p><b>Skittering Crawl.</b> You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and become able to hang on to even vertical surfaces. If you move at least 20 feet on the ground or as part of a climb, you can choose to take the Dodge action as a bonus action.</p>
                <p><b>Snatching Tail.</b> Your tail grows longer and more flexible, letting you unexpectedly catch your foes and yank them around. When you deal damage to a creature that is up to one size category larger than you with your tail, you can use your bonus action to force them to roll a Strength saving throw. On a failure, they are pulled to a space of your choosing within 10 feet of you. The space must be unoccupied.</p>
