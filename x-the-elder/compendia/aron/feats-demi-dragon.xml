            <p class="indent">A deep-seated greed takes hold of you, and the sight of wealth excites you. You can construct a hoard using any amount of your treasure anywhere you like; during a long rest, you magically link yourself to that spot, claiming it as your hoard. Coins, gems, art, and other nonmagical wealth contribute to your hoard, calculated in gold pieces. You can only be linked to one hoard at a time, and can only link yourself to a new hoard once every seven days. If any treasure is removed from the hoard, you immediately know what is being taken. You gain the following benefits based on how much wealth is stored in the hoard. If enough wealth is lost to put you below a wealth threshold, you lose all benefits associated with that threshold until you again have enough wealth to qualify.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b>Absorb Magic Enchantments.</b> The maximum limit of magic items that you can have absorbed with Absorb Magic increases by the listed amount for that threshold.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Siphon Treasure.</b> Your magical hunger extends across any distance to the extraordinary items stored in your hoard. You can use any piece of non-equipment treasure, such as a potion or wondrous item, that is stored within your hoard as if you were holding it. The item functions as normal, and is consumed on use or expends charges if it normally would. If the item requires itself to function, such as an immovable rod or a figurine of wondrous power, you conjure a spectral projection of it. Such a spectral projection represents the magical essence of the item being pulled forth by you, and any damage taken by such a projection carries over to the real item. An unattended projection fades after 1d4 hours.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Auric Slumber.</b> Whenever you finish a long rest while resting within 30 feet of your hoard, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your level, lasting for up to 7 days. In addition, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Unbound Attunement.</b> You can attune to up to four magic items at once. Additionally, you ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.</p>

If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. If the maneuver makes use of a horn or wing natural weapon, you add it to your list of natural weapons.</li>
                <li>You gain 2 points of fury, as described under the Embodiment of the Juggernaut. You can spend them on any Juggernaut maneuver you know and which you can pay the fury cost for. If you already had fury, your total increases by 2. You regain your expended fury when you finish a short or long rest.</li>
