        <description>
            <p>A human man runs through the city streets, blood flowing down his arm from an arrow lodged in his shoulder. He pushes past the crowds of people, desperately trying to escape, looking over his shoulder just in time to see an arrow fly from the shadows of an alleyway, right before it pierced his skull. A half-orc steps from the shadows to claim her kill, and more importantly, her bounty.</p>
            <p class="indent">Nimbly dodging out of the way of the dragon’s fiery breath, a goliath readies her maul, preparing to deliver a devastating blow. She rushes towards the drake, her weapon gripped in both hands as she slams the maul into the dragon’s chest with a resounding crack, breaking through its defenses and shattering its thick scales.</p>
            <p class="indent">A tiefling desperately fights off an armoured bear in the woods, doing all he can to keep the wild beast at bay, defending himself to the best of his ability, unaware of the half-elf hiding amongst the tree branches, reading her bow to deliver the finishing shot.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human strides confidently through the graveyard, cutting down the swarm of zombies and skeletons that stand before him, his silver blade glistening in the moonlight as he walks towards the necromancer controlling the undead beasts. Fear pierces the necromancer’s heart, his army reduced to ash, and as he falls to his knees in defeat, the hunter places his crossbow at the dark mage’s neck, the tip of the bolt digging slightly into his skin, begging to be released.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hunters are the ultimate survivors. No matter the odds, they have the skills and tools they need to turn the tides in their favour, and more importantly, to make it out alive.</p>
            <h4>MASTERS OF THE WILD</h4>
            <p>Hunters are masters of the wild, trained to survive in any environment. Over the many years, they have learned how to track and hunt, how to scavenge and sneak, and how to identify the many creatures that inhabit the wilds. While others blunder through forests and jungles and pace in circles across endless deserts and tundras, hunter’s effortlessly move through through the wilderness, unimpeded by the many natural obstacles that one may find.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hunter can survive no matter where they may find themselves. Whether it be a thick forest, the highest mountain, or the depths of the underdark, a hunter’s skills allow them to thrive in any environment. Regardless of the location they find themselves in, they are able to do whatever it takes to survive.</p>
            <h4>FOCUSED HUNTERS</h4>
            <p>Rather than focus on a single fighting style or form of magic, hunter’s hone their skills at hunting certain types of creatures. From the criminal chasing Bounty Hunter to the monster slaying Hellsinger, hunters specialize in hunting all manor of creatures.</p>
            <p class="indent">Despite focusing on hunting a certain type of foe, every hunter is adaptable, and is able to thrive against any type of monster. A trained hunter will never find a situation in which they don’t have some tool or trick to get themselves out of trouble, because a hunter that doesn’t have an answer to every problem is a hunter that won’t last very long in the wilds.</p>
            <h4>ONLY MORTAL</h4>
            <p>In a world full of mighty dragons, blood crazed warriors, god-like beings, reality bending mages, and fiendish creatures from hell, the hunter is simply an ordinary person. They have no magic, no divine powers, no supernatural abilities. But they don’t need any of that. A hunter has something more valuable than any of those things; a hunter has the will to survive.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hunters have learned how to survive in a crazy world full of demons, mages, monsters and more, honing their skills and wits, creating weapons and tools to aid them in combat, becoming smarter, faster, keener. For a hunter, the only thing they need to survive is their skills and their will. No matter what they find themselves up against, they will find a way to come out victorious.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Your training as a ranger has made you an adept hunter, allowing you to set traps and deal with enemies in quick succession. At 2nd level, you gain access to Ranger Tricks, a series of specialized techniques and traps that you can use.</p>
                <p class="indent">Ranger tricks are special abilities that rangers can use to gain an edge in combat. They come in three forms: Techniques, special attack options, Traps, which take time to set up, and Trick Shots, special arrows that have additional effects. For tricks that require something specific, like a special arrow or materials for a trap, you are assumed to have prepared them in advance. Abilities that fire arrows or bolts are assumed to have the same range as your weapon’s normal range unless stated otherwise.</p>
                <p class="indent">You gain two ranger tricks, which are detailed at the end of the class decription. You can use your ranger tricks a number of times equal to you Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher (minimum of 1), and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest. As you level up, you gain more ranger tricks, as shown in the Ranger Tricks column in the Ranger table, and your ranger tricks become more powerful.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you level up in this class, you can replace one ranger trick you know with a different one.</p>
                <p class="indent">Some of your ranger tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick’s effects or to detect them. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Trick Save DC</b> = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier</p>

After all, a hunter is nothing if not adaptable.</p>

Each conclave specializes in hunting a certain type of creature, though their skills can be used in a wide variety of situations. Choose between the Bounty Hunter, the Beast Master, the Deep Stalker, the Dragon Slayer, the Horizon Walker, the Hellsinger, or the Anti-Mage. Your choice grants you a feature at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>
