            <p>Most rogues prefer to work alone, tending to keep to themselves. However, you know the value of working with others. But instead of relying on people who might betray your trust, you’ve trained a majestic and powerful bird to fight by your side. As a falconer, you work together with your falcon both in and out of combat, giving you the upper hand. While other rogues sulk in their loneliness, you have the companionship of a loyal friend.</p>

                <p>Starting at 3rd level, you’ve gained the assistance of a trained falcon to aid you in your travels. The falcon uses the stat block below, however rather than dying when it falls to 0 hit points, it becomes scared and flees from combat, returning to you at the end of a short or long rest, with all of its hit points recovered.</p>
                <p class="indent">While you have your falcon with you, you have advantage on all perception checks that rely on sight.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, your falcon is trained to aid you in combat. As a bonus action, you can have your falcon use its movement, and give it one of the following commands:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Keep them busy!:</b> Your falcon distracts a creature within 5 feet of it, giving you advantage on your next attack against that creature.</li>
                    <li><b>Sick em!:</b> Your falcon makes one attack against a creature within 5 feet of it using its talons.</li>
                    <li><b>Eyes in the Sky!:</b> Your falcon circles the air around you and makes a perception check, alerting you to hidden enemies within 30 feet of you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">If you are unconscious, your falcon does not act, as you are not there to command it. Additionally, your falcon is unable to make attacks of opportunity.</p>

                <p>At 9th level, you’ve trained your falcon to aim for the enemies eyes, potentially blinding them. When you falcon hits a creature with its talon attack, it can force them to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + Your prof bonus + falcon’s dex). On a failure, the creature is blinded for 1 minute. The creature can remake this saving throw at the end of their turn, ending the effect on a success.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your falcon can use this ability a number of times equal to their Dexterity modifier. They regain all uses at the end of a long rest.</p>

                <p>At 13th level, your falcon’s Battle Commands are improved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Keep them busy!:</b> When your falcon is distracting a creature, that creature also has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn.</li>
                    <li><b>Sick em!:</b> Your falcon’s attacks are considered magical for the sake of overcoming resistances. Additionally, your falcon can attack twice instead of once when you use this command.</li>
                    <li><b>Eyes in the Sky!:</b> Your falcon has advantage on the perception check, and the range of this command is increased to 60 feet.</li>

                <p>At 17th level, the bond between you and your falcon inspires you both to keep fighting. Your falcon is able to use your Evasion feature, and gains a special reaction that it can use to use your Uncanny Dodge feature.</p>

                <p class="indent">Finally, when your falcon falls to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to rally it, healing it for half of its maximum hit points. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
