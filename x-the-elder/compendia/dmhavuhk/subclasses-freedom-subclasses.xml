        <description>
            <p>The path of a paladin is not an easy one. Holding to an oath can be a difficult endeavour. There are many paladins that break the oaths that they have sworn. Perhaps they were not able to uphold the tenants of their oath, or they abandoned the oath they swore to an evil god. For whatever reason, your oath has been broken. But while most people who break their oath lose everything they had gained, youâ€™ve managed to hold on to a small ember. With enough time and training, perhaps you can fan this ember into a flame.</p>

                <p>As ex-paladins, the Unsworn do not have any oaths that they are forced to follow. There are some that still attempt to uphold the tenants of their previous oath, in an attempt to regain their lost light, but most Unsworn are free to carve their own path.</p>

                    <p>Without an oath, your DM may decide that your paladin powers have lessened. If they do so, your abilities change in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lay on hands. The pool of hit points for your lay on hands is 3 x your paladin level.</li>
                        <li>Divine Smite. Your Divine Smite deals 1d8 damage with a 1st level spell slot, instead of 2d8.</li>
