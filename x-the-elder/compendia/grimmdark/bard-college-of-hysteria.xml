            <p>The followers of the College of Hysteria hear music in the leaves and voices in the wind. They can often be found performing with mundane objects as their instruments in ways those before them never thought of. They tell tales of the forest orchestras and plays directed by the river, magnificent songs sung by a strand of spider web. They find the music, wherever it may be, and breathe life and power into it. Often you can find them traveling the roads alone, talking or singing to themselves, all the more content to listen to the music of the fey.</p>
            <p class="indent">To join the College of Hysteria, one has to be a little mad. At least, they must seem mad to the outside world. Their name derives from their weird use of instruments and their fey—like songs. These bards seek to share their experiences with others, even if it drives them insane in the process.</p>

                <p>At the 3rd level. you can hear the music of the world in all its fey, dream—like nature. You may expend a bardic inspiration dice as a reaction whenever a spell is cast. Either the caster of the spell or the target of the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed or frightened (your choice) for the number of rounds rolled. This effect automatically ends if the creature suffers damage from you or an ally.</p>

                <p>Once you reach the 6th level. your spells are distorted by your madness and mania, and those that suffer them become transfixed and enthralled by your insanity. When you cast a spell requiring a spell saving throw versus one of yours, they use their Intelligence ability score instead of the ability score normally required by the spell.</p>

                <p>Upon reaching the 14th level. you have learned to spread your hysteria to others through song and tale. Upon spending a bardic inspiration die without using the Do You Hear What I Hear feature, you can spend another standard die using a bonus action.</p>
