            <p>Storm wardens understand the wrath of nature better than anyone. They harness the power of unpredictability through storms, warping air currents around themselves to empower their own abilities and manipulate the world they walk. Rangers that follow this path know how quickly the world can change and how powerful a storm of all kinds can be.</p>

                <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Storm Warden Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you have learned to channel the power of lightning into a particular weapon. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one weapon that you are proficient with. This weapon becomes your storm weapon. When you attack with your storm weapon, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All damage dealt by a weapon attack with your storm weapon becomes lightning damage.</li>
                    <li>When you roll a 20 on your attack roll, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, becoming stunned on a failure until the beginning of your next turn.</li>
                    <li>Once on each of your turns, when you hit with the attack roll, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.</li>
