            <p>You place a randomised curse on a creature that you can see within range. Roll a d6 and assign a number to each of the six ability scores (1 is Strength, 2 is Dexterity, 3 is Constitution, 4 is Intelligence, 5 is Wisdom, 6 is Charisma). The target has disadvantage on any ability checks or saving throws using the rolled ability score.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">A remove curse cast on the target ends this spell early.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th or higher, you can roll an additional d6 for every two spell levels above 3rd, choosing between the results.</p>

            <p>You conjure a 30 foot sphere at a point you can see within range. The sphere has a soft, hazy look to it. The sphere is filled with pure, clean air which suppresses water or unclean air from entering the sphere. Any overpowering stench becomes much more manageable for creatures inside the sphere, regardless of whether the source of the smell is outside or inside the sphere. Any spell or magical effect of 4th level or lower that creates a toxic cloud or similar magic cannot enter the sphere. The sphere does not penetrate full cover.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can choose to concentrate on this spell to pause its duration until you choose to stop concentrating, or to move the sphere at a speed of 30 feet to another location.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the sphere resists magic of an additional level higher for each spell level above 4th.</p>

Each creature within 5 feet of this line must succeed a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 6d12 fire damage. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is turned to ash. The ash is considered an intact corpse under the effects of the gentle repose spell for the purposes of resurrection magic.</p>

            <p>You bless the ground around you, allowing fruit, crops and flowers to grow better and stronger. While the spell persists, any plant life in a 1 mile radius centred on you grows 10 times as quickly, and any yield gathered within this area produces three times the results. Any ingredients harvested from this area will be of the utmost quality and cleared of any toxins. The area doesn't move with you and when you cast this spell again, your previous instance of this spell ends.</p>

            <p>You plant a seed into the soil, nursing it for the duration of the casting time. Upon casting the spell, the seed will begin to grow into a beautiful, extremely large oak tree. The seed will take a year to grow to its maximum height of 3000 feet, with a trunk of diameter 500 feet. If any object is blocking the trees growth, the object is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space. If there is no such space, the obstacle is consumed by the tree.</p>
            <p class="indent">The tree's trunk is hollow, and it the sheer size and strength of the tree allows a village to be created on and inside it. The tree can support and nourish 200 people. Any creature within 10 miles of this tree feels its vitality, and requires half the amount of rations they normally would to survive. Creatures within 1 mile of the tree are completely sustained by the trees magic, no longer requiring food and drink. Creatures can choose to attune to the tree, taking up one of their attunement slots. If they choose to do so, they do not require food or drink even when outside the reach of the World Tree.</p>
            <p class="indent">The World Tree can only be destroyed through a cataclysmic event, such as a meteor, a volcano erupting, a tsunami or an earthquake of unimaginable magnitude. If the World Tree is destroyed, it drops a seed that can be used as material to cast this spell again.</p>
