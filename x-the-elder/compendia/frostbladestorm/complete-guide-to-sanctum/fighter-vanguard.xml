            <p>The Vanguard believes in an eye for an eye: in retaliation against those who have wronged them. Vanguard's have attuned themselves to this principle, enduring the relentless aggression of the enemy and striking back with their own strength. A Vanguard isn't just a normal warrior, but one that seizes every opportunity, embracing their awareness and striking when an opening presents itself.</p>
