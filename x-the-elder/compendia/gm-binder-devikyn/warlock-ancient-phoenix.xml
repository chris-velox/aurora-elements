            <p>Your patron is a phoenix which has survived thousands of years of pursuit. This being has settled on the elemental plane of fire, and is so suffused with magical energy that its powerful magic can be siphoned through rituals, even on the innermost planes.</p>

                <p>Would-be Warlocks who make contact with an ancient phoenix are accidentally exposed to the raw life energy infused into a phoenix’s essence. This change to the composition of your soul causes minor incompatibilities with its vessel. You may roll or choose from the following quirks to add manifestations of this change to your character.</p>

                <p>Your Book of Shadows transforms into a Grimoire of the Phoenix. Dancing along the cover are licks of radiant flame which are harmless, but warm to the touch. Once per turn when you deal fire or radiant damage, you can create a wave of fire in a 5-foot radius around one of the targets. Creatures in the area take fire or radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>

                <p>You can use your action when your Phoenix Sprite is perched on your shoulder to merge its magic with your form. Your arms blaze with fire in the shape of wings and you a fiery mask with a feather attached to it appears on your face. While in this merged form, you gain the Phoenix Sprite’s fly speed. The Phoenix Sprite’s body becomes dismissed to a pocket dimension, and can be recalled as an action, to end this effect and cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.</p>
