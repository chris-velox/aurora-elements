            <p>A stark contrast to the psion, the wilder draws upon raw emotion to fuel both psionic and magical abilities. These unique creatures command a mixture of powerful abilities, often in an overwhelming and confusing capacity. As such, wilders can glimpse power far beyond their normal means, if only for a brief moment, and at perilous risk. Wilders seek adventure, as it is an opportunity for them to hone their emotion-shaped powers, as well as to put their skills to the test. For a wilder, every surge of emotion is both a euphoria and an epiphany.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, psionic energy naturally flows out of you, subtly influencing the behavior of others you meet.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are within 10 feet of a creature when you speak to it for the first time, that creature feels an implacable bond of kinship with you. This bond makes the creature treat you as a friend, rather than a neutral acquaintance. The GM decides the extent of this benefit, and while it typically doesn’t mean the creature will afford you special favors, it becomes easier for you to befriend the creature. This feature has no effect on a creature that is already hostile to you before you meet it.</p>

            <p>Also at 1st level, you can choose from the telepath spell list, in addition to the sorcerer spell list, when you learn a new sorcerer spell. Spells you learn in this way count as sorcerer spells for you, and you don’t need to provide verbal and somatic components when you cast them.</p>

            <p>At 6th level, embracing a heightened emotional state allows your spells to flare with additional power.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can spend any number of sorcery points to surge with emotion, empowering the spell. If you do, the spell’s level increases by the same number of levels as the amount of sorcery points you spent, up to the maximum spell slot level available for your sorcerer level. After augmenting a spell in this way, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the spell level at which the spell was cast) or be stunned until the start of your next turn.</p>
