          <p>If you also expend 1-5 psionic power when you cast the spell, the weight that the hand can carry increases by 100 pounds for each point spent, and for the duration, you can use your action to move the hand up to 30 feet and then make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the hand, dealing 1d6 force damage plus 1d6 per point spent on a hit.</p>

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>

The memory must be 10 seconds or less in duration, and you remember it as if you were observing it, rather than experiencing it yourself. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect. On a success, you can’t access its memory, and it is aware you tried to read its mind.</p>

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>

When you cast this spell, choose sight, hearing, taste or smell; your choice determines which sense is linked for the duration. Choose a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or have its senses linked with yours. A willing creature can choose to fail the save.</p>
          <p>You cannot influence the creature’s behavior with this spell. However, you can emulate its senses freely as if you were in its body, but only from its point of view. This allows you to make ability checks while benefitting from a creature’s unique features, among other things. For example, you can smell through the nose of a wolf that is hiding in a bush, and you would smell the bush as well as yourself, as the wolf would. You can also see through the eyes of a hawk in flight, allowing you to get a bird’s eye view with its exceptional vision.</p>

          <p>You form psionic energy into malleable crystals, which you launch at a creature. Make a ranged psionic attack against a creature you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 piercing damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be encased in crystal.</p>
          <p>An encased creature can still breath but is otherwise helpless, being unable to see or take any physical actions. The subject cannot speak because the crystals distort sounds. While a creature is encased in a crystal cocoon, it cannot be targeted with attacks, spells, or other effects, and it cannot be damaged by sources outside of the cocoon.</p>
          <p>As an action, the target can make a Strength(Athletics) check against your spell save DC to break free. The crystal cocoon can also be damaged from the outside; it has 16 AC and 30 hit points. If the crystal cocoon is reduced to 0 hit points, its effects end on that creature. Any remaining damage is ignored.</p>
          <p><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> If cast at 4th level or higher, this spell’s damage increases by 1d8 and the crystal cocoon’s hit points increase by 10 per spell level above 3rd. If cast at 6th level or higher, you can encase Huge or smaller creatures.</p>

          <p>You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a dollop of thick, gooey material called quintessence that weighs 0.1 lb. The substance shimmers like a silver mirror. Psionic creatures can handle quintessence by shielding itself with a small amount of psionic energy when touching it. However, they must do so with care, as quintessence inhibits psionics. A psionic creature within 5 feet of at least 1 lb of quintessence cannot use its psionic abilities, and it can only properly handle the quintessence if it succeeds on an Intelligence check of DC 10 plus 1 per lb of quintessence.</p>
          <p>You can use your action to smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object, such as a key, a ring, a seal, or an insignia. Objects sealed with quintessence are protected from the effects of time, entering a state of stasis. Large quantities of quintessence can be gathered to preserve large items or structures, or even a complete living creature.</p>
          <p>You can also use your action to apply a dollop of quintessence to a small amount of a creature’s living flesh, partially pulling it out of the time stream. Make a ranged psionic attack against one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target is affected by quintessence, which forces it to take 1d4 force damage at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute, at which point the quintessence is too disrupted to be effective.</p>
          <p>Each dollop of quintessence can be used only once. Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you do this, the quintessence is not recovered.</p>

          <p>If you die, your physical body crumbles to dust, leaving all of your equipment, and your soul transfers into the storage gem as long as it is on the same plane of existence. The gem begins to glow, and any attempt to bring your soul back to life fails while you inhabit it. Once this effect occurs, you can hear and see as if you were in the gem’s space, but you cannot move or interact in any way that the gem couldn’t. You may remain in this form for up to 30 days, after which your soul disengages from the gem and passes on.</p>
          <p>You can slowly generate a new clone of your living body over the course of 10 days, during which time you must be completely undisturbed; even hearing the slightest noise will break your concentration and ruin the clone, making it uninhabitable and leaving you no way to continue regenerating it. Your original body’s constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm through the astral plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time you manifested <em>astral regeneration</em>. If the developing body takes any kind of damage while forming, it becomes ruined and uninhabitable. When the tenth day ends, the crystal crumbles and merges with your new body, and you completely and totally inhabit it.</p>

          <p class="flavor"><strong>Display: </strong>Psionic energy flakes off of everything within the area and disappears</p>
          <p>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of deadening influence surrounds you, nullifying psionics. In this area, psionic energy is immediately discharged, becoming inert. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast by using psionics, and psionically summoned creatures and objects disappear. For the duration, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.</p>
          <p>Psionic spells and other psionic effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. Psionic power expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.</p>
          <ul> <li><strong>Targeted Effects.</strong> Psionic spells and other psionic effects, such as <em>magic missile</em> and <em>cause fear</em>, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.</li> <li><strong>Areas of Psionics.</strong> The area of another psionic effect, such as <em>detonation</em>, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of psionics, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the wood created by a <em>wall of wood</em> is suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.</li> <li><strong>Psionics.</strong> Any active psionic effect or spell on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.</li> <li><strong>Psionic Travel.</strong> Teleportation and planar travel caused by psionics fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the <em>rope trick</em> spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.</li> <li><strong>Creatures and Objects.</strong> A creature or object summoned or created by psionics temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.</li> <li><strong>Negate Psionics.</strong> Spells such as <em>negate psionics</em> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, different <em>nullify psionics</em> spells don’t nullify each other.</li> </ul>

          <p>Every foot moved through the wall costs 1 extra foot of movement. When a creature moves into the wall’s space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, taking 9d6 thunder damage on a failure, or half on a success. On a failed save, a creature is pushed in a straight line 30 feet away from the wall, and is knocked prone. If it collides with an object, it takes 4d6 thunder damage as the shock wracks its body.</p>

          <p>The fused being has your hit points plus the other creature’s hit points. The fused being knows all of the spells, has the same amount of psionic power, knows or has prepared the same spells, and has the same amount of spell slots as both creatures combined. Any spent psionic power or spell slots prior to the fusion are retained on the fused being. Likewise, all feats, racial abilities, and class features are pooled (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being gains it only once.) For each of the six ability scores, the fused being’s score is the higher of yours and the other creature’s, its Hit Dice are those of both creatures combined, and the fused being has the higher level of the two creatures. The fused being gains all proficiencies and expertise of both beings.</p>

If separation occurs in a space without room for both creatures, both creatures are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, take 12d6 force damage and are stunned for 1 minute. </p>
          <p>Damage taken by the fused being is discarded when the spell ends. Each constituent creature of the fusion is returned with exactly the same amount of hit points it had before it entered the fusion. However, any resources spent by the fused being are transferred to the original creatures when <em>fusion</em> ends. Any debilitating effects are split between you and the other creature. If any effects cannot be evenly split, you determine who receives the additional loss.</p>
          <p>If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent creatures, both of which are also dead. You cannot use <em>fusion</em> on a being already fused by this spell.</p>

          <p>You can’t move or harm items held, carried or worn by a creature stuck in standard time, but you can affect any item that is unattended.</p>
          <p>When <em>temporal velocity</em> lapses, you are disoriented on your return to the standard time frame. You suffer disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks until the end of your next turn.</p>
