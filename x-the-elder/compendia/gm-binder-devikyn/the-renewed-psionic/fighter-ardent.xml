            <p>Ardents are fiercely driven psionic fighters that center their personalities around certain inevitable philosophies, rather than honing the discipline of their minds. Universal truths afford power to these psionically talented warriors, who train their mind and body in accordance with a lifetime of understanding and personal experiences. Ardents are driven by emotion towards goals that align with their philosophies, as their conviction leads them to ever greater understanding and, subsequently, power.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, your dedication towards embracing an inevitable facet of the universe begins to manifest as psionic power. You embrace two of the options listed under "Ardent Inevitabilities" below. You embrace another option at 10th and 18th level in this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your first choice of ardent inevitability becomes your focus. While you are focused on an inevitability, you have the benefits listed under that option. You can only focus on one inevitability at a time, and you can change your focus to another inevitability option that you know when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, you draw from your psionic well of power through your focus on philosophy, which allows you to learn psionic spells.</p>
            <h5>PSIONICS</h5>
            <p>You use a method of spellcasting known as psionics, which harnesses your mental energy to warp reality into wondrous effects. Due to the nature of psionics, you ignore the components of any psion spells you have prepared, except material components that are consumed by the spell. Spells cast using psionics are unaffected by effects that negate magic, such as counterspell, dispel magic, and anti-magic field.</p>
            <h5>PSIONIC TALENTS</h5>
            <p>You learn three talents of your choice from the psion spell list. You learn another psion talent of your choice at 10th level in this class.</p>
            <h5>LEARNING SPELLS</h5>
            <p>You know two psion spells of your choice, and one spell of your choice from any psion discipline’s spell list. The Ardent Innate Spellcasting table shows when you learn more spells of 1st level or higher. Each spell must be chosen from the psion spell list, and must be of a level no greater than the number shown in the Psionic Power Limit column for your fighter level.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 8th, 14th, and 20th levels in this class, the spells you choose can come from any discipline’s spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the spells you know with another spell of your choice. The new spell must be of a level no greater than the number shown in the Psionic Power Limit column for your fighter level, and it must be a psion spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any discipline’s spell list.</p>
            <h5>PSIONIC POWER</h5>
            <p>The Ardent Innate Spellcasting table shows how much psionic power you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend psionic power equal to the spell’s level when you cast it. You regain all expended psionic power when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a level 8 fighter and you know the 1st-level spell <em>magic missile</em>, you can spend 1 psionic power to cast it at 1st level or 2 psionic power to cast it at 2nd level. There is a limit to the amount of psionic power you can sustain at a time; you can’t cast a spell if its psionic power cost is greater than your Psionic Power Limit.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>ntelligence is your ability for your psionic spells, since they are created out of psionic energy and shaped by your mind. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a psionic spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent">Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <p class="indent">Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
