        <description>
            <p>Monks of the way of the lurker, also known as lurks, combine their spiritual abilities with their innate psionic talents. Due to the exceptional level of control lurks enact over themselves, these monks most often display an unearthly serenity. Their talents lend well to becoming assassins or envoys, as they are exceptionally suited to thwarting both magic and psionics alike. However, lurks usually have a strong moral code; as such, while their abilities are exceptionally desirable, their services may be hard sought as they will generally only fight for a cause they believe is right.</p>

            <p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you combine psionics and ki to draw energy from others, sapping their abilities and wracking their bodies with pain.</p>
            <p class="indent">You gain one augmentation from the list of Lurk Augmentations below, which are methods of producing psionics-laden ki abilities. You gain one more as you gain levels in this class: 6th level, 11th level, and 17th level. Some augmentations require you to reach a certain level before you can learn them. If an augmentation lists a level as a prerequisite, it refers to your level in this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a new augmentation, you can also replace one augmentation you know with another one. You must meet the prerequisites, if any, for your new choice.</p>
