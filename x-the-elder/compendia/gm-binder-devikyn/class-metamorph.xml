        <description>
            <p>A class based on the sorcerer, the metamorph can be used alongside the normal sorcerer or as a replacement for it. In this document, I've opted to replace the sorcerer's bulky resource systems entirely with more at-will abilities. To do so, I reduced the class's spellcasting abilities and gave it several new features. This also warranted a new name, and comes with some interesting tricks I'll detail below.</p>
            <h5>ANCESTRAL FORMS</h5>
            <p>Instead of sorcerous origins, you pick the forms that your ancestor's physiology and powers took. These forms will make themselves known to the world, as your physically transform into an amalgam of your race and your ancestor's, which grants you some of their powers. These effects will seem familiar to sorcerer players, but many of them are brand new options that I've carefully crafted.</p>
            <h5>INNATE SPELLCASTING</h5>
            <p>With Innate Spellcasting, you choose a spell at each of the same levels that a half-caster would gain a new spell. You can cast each of these spells once per long rest that you take. The gap created here is covered with abilities granted by your ancestral form, as well as with willpower.</p>
            <h5>WILLPOWER</h5>
            <p>Willpower is an adapted version of sorcery points that you can use to cast your innate spells beyond their lowest level. There are a few features that allow you to spend willpower on them, as well, but most have been tweaked or eliminated. The unique part of this is that you can cast your innate spells beyond 5th level in this manner. You can't learn 6th to 9th level spells, but that doesn't mean you can't cast them!</p>
            <h5>OTHER NEW FEATURES</h5>
            <p>Beyond these major changes, there are several new features in the class and the ancestral forms that fill in the half-caster progression and that allow you the freedom to easily shape your magic. Enjoy!</p>
			<h4>CREATING A METAMORPH</h4>
			<p>The most important question to consider when creating your metamorph is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to an ancestral bloodline, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p>
			<p class="indent">How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a metamorph quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st-level spell magic missile.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an metamorph, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>

                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per metamorph level after 1st</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The <i>Player's Handbook</i> contains rules for multiclassing, which allows you to create a character with levels in more than one class. The following rules are added to the Spellcasting section.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b> If you have the Innate Spellcasting feature, whenever you require a spell slot for one of your spells or features, you can instead expend the use of one of your spells from Innate Spellcasting to create a spell slot of the same level as the expended spell.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Overfocus.</b> Whenever you use a a spell from your Innate Spellcasting feature to create a spell slot, you can also expend willpower to increase the level of the slot. You must still follow the other rules of the Overfocus feature.</p>

                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the metamorph spell list. You learn more metamorph cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the metamorph table.</p>
                <h5>INNATE SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>Choose one 1st-level spell from the metamorph spell list. You can cast the chosen spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can do so again. You can forego the material components for spells you cast in this way, unless they have a cost or are consumed by the spell. When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of these metamorph spells and replace it with another spell from the metamorph spell list, which must be of the same spell level as the spell you're replacing.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can choose an additional metamorph spell to cast in this way at each of the metamorph levels shown in the Innate Spells table. The same spell can be chosen again, which allows you to cast it an additional time. The spells you choose must also be of a level no greater than the spell level shown in the Innate Spells table.</p>

                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your metamorph spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a metamorph spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell save DC</i></b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>

					<p>This form unleashes the aberrant truth hidden within your flesh. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 willpower to magically transform your body, gaining one of the following benefits of your choice, the effects of which last while you are in this form:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and the ability to breathe water. Gills grow from your neck or fan out from behind your ears, your fingers become webbed, or you grow lashing cilia that extend through your clothing.</li>
						<li>You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. As you fly, your skin glistens with mucus.</li>
						<li>Your body, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, becomes slimy and pliable. You can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, and you can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.</li>
						<li>Your eyes turn black or become writhing sensory tendrils. You know the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 60 feet of you.</li>

Other creatures treat the aura as difficult terrain, and when they start their turn in it, they take 2d10 psychic damage.

Its appearance must accommodate its features, size and traits, but it can otherwise be of your description.

You can command the scout to make one melee weapon attack with its sting, targeting one creature within 5 feet of it, as part of the action used to summon it, and as an action on subsequent turns. The sting's attack bonus is 4 + your proficiency modifier, and it deals 1d6 + 2 piercing damage, plus 1d8 poison damage. The poison damage increases as you gain levels in this class: 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p>

					<p>As an action, you can summon a mindless, subservient scout to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, which is dismissed when you shed this form. You can also dismiss it early by using your bonus action. The scout uses the statistics of the collective scout. Its appearance must accommodate its features, size and traits, but it can otherwise be of your description. In combat, the scout shares your initiative and takes the Dodge action, moving away from immediate danger.</p>
					<p class="indent">You can have a number of scouts at a time equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>

					<p>When you summon a scout, you can equip it with a potent sting. Only one of your scouts can have this sting at a time. You can command the scout to make one melee weapon attack with its sting, targeting one creature within 5 feet of it, as part of the action used to summon it, and as an action on subsequent turns. The sting's attack bonus is 4 + your proficiency modifier, and it deals 1d6 + 2 piercing damage, plus 1d8 poison damage. The poison damage increases as you gain levels in this class: 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.</p>

These are most commonly descendants of creatures doomed to Hades by a curse, but some come to be by ritual, possession, or some other demonic encounter. These metamorphs have magical abilities warped in dark and deranged ways, allowing them to capture and manipulate the souls of fallen creatures.

                <p>When you awaken this ancestral form at 1st level, some of your ancestors' traits begin to manifest upon you. The following forms are available to you:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Soul Attractor.</i></b> While in this form, you can see the incorporeal form of other creatures' souls, and when you are within 5 feet of the soul of a creature that died in the last minute, you can use your action to capture that soul if the creature's CR is no greater than your metamorph level. You can have a number of captured souls equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1) at any given time. A soul you've captured can't be resurrected until it is freed. When you deal damage with a spell or a weapon attack, you can drain one captured soul's energy, freeing the soul and dealing an extra 1d10 force damage. The damage increases to 2d10 when you reach 11th level in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent">The soul flutters and revolves around you for 8 hours, after which is it freed and moves on. During this time, you can ask the soul one question. If you do, the soul must make a Charisma saving throw - using its creature statistics - against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the soul is compelled to answer truthfully with whatever detail it knew in life. Otherwise, it is free to answer as it would normally.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Hellscape Vision.</i></b> While in this form, you can use your bonus action to gain darkvision as far as you can see, or to suppress this darkvision. Magical darkness can't impede this darkvision, and you can't see color with it, only shades of grey. Hellscape vision overwhelms you with apathy, imposing disadvantage on your attack rolls and ability checks. If you have a captured soul, you can use your action to drain some of the soul's energy, suppressing this apathy for 1 minute and freeing the soul afterward.</p>

                <p>Starting at 18th level, you can call forth a fiend to create a contract in exchange for souls.</p>
                <p class="indent">By spending 1 minute in concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and choosing any number of your currently captured souls, you can call forth a fiend from its native plane. Based on the number of souls offered, a creature appears in an unoccupied space of the DM's choice within 30 feet of you. Consult the Barter Souls Summoning table to find the creatures you can summon.</p>
                <p class="indent">The fiend remains under control of the DM at all times. It offers a contract: assistance with a single task or goal in exchange for the amount of trapped souls shown in the Barter Souls Summoning table. You describe this task or goal in up to two sentences, which the fiend uses to forge the contract and immediately receive its payment. The fiend interprets your contract in good faith, and it executes a given contract to the best of its ability; however, it does not treat you as an ally for purposes beyond the calling of its contract, and its contractual obligations end if you die.</p>
                <p class="indent">The fiend is likely to look for ways it can extract further compensation from you, and is capable of offering further deals. Once its contracts are fulfilled, or if the fiend is reduced to 0 hit points, it returns to its place of origin.</p>

                <p>Starting at 6th level, you become inherently able to amplify your kinetic force with magic, and you learn to create a small, localized field of dense gravity that's difficult to pierce.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you deal damage to a creature with a spell, you can push or pull the creature up to 10 feet. You can spend willpower to increase the distance that the creature is pushed or pulled by 10 feet per willpower spent.</p>
                <p class="indent">Also, when you are attacked by a source within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to create a field of rejecting gravity, encapsulating and slowing the strike. You gain resistance to the attack's damage, and if the attacker is a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature cannot make attacks until the start of its next turn. Once you have used this reaction, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

                <p class="indent"><b><i>Shifting Form.</i></b> While in this form, you gain the ability to enter a liquid state while moving. When you move on your turn, you take only half damage from opportunity attacks, and you can move through any creature's space. You can't enter a creature's space if doing so would leave you with 0 remaining movement, and you can't end your turn in a creature's space.</p>
                <p class="indent">On your turn, you can move through any space that is at least 3 inches in diameter and do so without squeezing. When you stop moving, the regular squeezing rules apply if you're in a space one size smaller than you. You can't willingly stop in a space smaller than that, and if you're forced to do so, you immediately flow to the nearest space that can fit you, back along the path of your movement.</p>

                <p class="indent"><b><i>Eyes of the Dark.</i></b> While in this form, you have darkvision out to a distance of 120 feet. If you already have darkvision to a distance of less than 120 feet, its distance becomes 120 feet.

Additionally, you can use your action to force one creature within 120 feet of you and that can see your eyes to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and it is blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Caller of Darkness.</i></b> While in this form, you can cast the darkness spell by expending 2 willpower. You can see through the darkness created by the spell when you cast it in this way.</p>

                <p>Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point. You can’t use this feature if you are reduced to 0 hit points by radiant damage or by a critical hit.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf’s statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C in the Player’s Handbook), with the following changes: The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>
                    <li>It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
                    <li>At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</p>

                <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can grant an aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The aegis is a dim, gray aura of earth magic that protects the target. Any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2 + your sorcerer level divided by 4. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.</p>
