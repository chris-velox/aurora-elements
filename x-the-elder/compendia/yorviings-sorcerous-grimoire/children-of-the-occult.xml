        <description>
            <p>While some sorcerers claim that their powers were granted to them through some past encounter that passed through the bloodline, sorcerers of the Blood Soul origin actually make use of their very blood themselves. Perhaps this ability originates from a terrible mating with an ancient vampire. Or, it could be that some terrible event caused your body to be exposed to terrible magic, changing the course of your blood forever. Whatever the case may be, sorcerers who use their own blood have are hardy, strong, and clever in the execution of their magical powers.</p>

            <p class="indent">While acceptance of mages and wizards wielding flame, ice, or lightning is generally greeted warmly, you might not be. The use of your very bones for magic has taken a toll on your body’s outward appearance, scarring your skin. Some might see you as a tool to be used for power, while others might shy away from the very sight of you. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Bone Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quick quirk for your character.</p>

            <p>In some places in the world, the spectral forms of spirits, ghosts, and banshees reside, subject to the torment of an afterlife undeserved, or having been cursed to never truly rest. Your innate magic is tied to one of these ethereal creatures, and it is through some circumstance that it awakened within you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Perhaps you almost died, but something in your mind or body held you back from the near brink of death. Another cause could have been the exposure to a place with angry, vengeful, or mournful spirits, whose magic rubbed off on you by choice or by proxy. Slowly, over time, you become more and more like a spirit yourself, and your sorcerous power grows from this transformation.</p>

            <p>The power of witches and hags is a mysterious one, often met with fear and suspicion. You are a sorcerer who has obtained the power of witches and hags, giving you access to curses, rituals, and the summoning of abyssal creatures. It could have been that you had a witch or even a hag in your family tree, and that power descended through the line to you. Or, perhaps you were a child who was stolen by a hag, and was intended to become one, but something inside of you stopped that process, yet maintained the raw magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">However you obtained your magical powers, you are a sorcerer who has learned some of the dark powers that are often practiced by those apostates and hedge witches of the lands.</p>

Once the mount has been summoned, you begin creating a tiny effigy that resembles either an animal or inanimate object of your choice. The appearance of the summoned mount changes to resemble that of the effigy, though the stats of the mount remain unchanged otherwise. Additionally, you can change the mount’s size to be either Small, Medium, or Large.</p>
