        <description>
            <p>There exist those sorcerers who maintain power from the very earth beneath them, bending metal or stone to their will. However, there is an even more rare type of earth magic that revolves around the manipulation and use of crystals. Crystals are used in various methods throughout the world, from such properties as healing, elecricity, ice, or divining.</p>
            <p class="indent">Perhaps you came in contact with a crystal filled with volatile magic, or you were born underground, surrounded by a crystal vein that lies dormant in the earth. Whatever the reason, your power over earth and crystal is a rare and incredible form of magic.</p>

However you have a unique and immense power over sand, and are a perfect being for surviving the trials and mirages of the desert.

Or, you came into contact with a mirage, peculiar plant, or ancient ruin within a desert, and your magic awoke from the interaction you had with it. However your powers emerged for you, you are a valuable traveling companion and a spirit of the very desert itself.</p>

            <p>Your innate magic comes a connection to the magic of elemental earth. Perhaps your lineage can be traced back to some being from the Plane of Earth, or perhaps your ancestor or even yourself may have gained the favor of a powerful being from deep within the earth.</p>
            <p class="indent">However, whereas some sorcerers with this magical link have command over stone and rock, your magic gives you additonal power over metals, such as iron and steel. This magical command over metal lends you to being a tough being, and many fear your iron will and your metallic magic, almost as if you are a construct yourself.</p>

To witness one erupt is a frightening force to witness, yet to encounter one who can harness the power of one is even more disturbing. You are such a being, capable of wielding the fire and ash of a volcano.

            <p>Long, sharp protruding crystals or metal emerge from out of your elbows and palms as you begin to quickly spin around. You hurl yourself into a spinning dance, moving in a straight line to an unoccupied space you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet of the line you travel must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d10 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
