            <p>Your innate magic stems from a the powerful forces of explosives and explosions. Through some bizarre event, you have gained an ability to harness effects that burn and push others away, and devastate both flesh and stone alike. You might have survived a terrible detonation, being the sole living being in the aftermath. Or, perhaps you were created by a mighty alchemist in an attempt to create the perfect weapon. Whatever the case may be, you are an incredible power and strength.</p>

            <p>To many, drinking alcohol is a past time, something that one does when they are sad, angry, or wanting to find some way to escape from reality, or even have a good time. However, to you, drinking is a lifestyle. Making, drinking, and selling alcohol is like second nature to you, and this is due your magical influence over wines and meads. Perhaps you were blessed by a god of harvests or wine, such as Bacchus or Dionysus. Or, perhaps your family’s bloodline is tied to a magical connection to wineries, meaderies, or vineyards, or you may have even once drank from a very special, magical alcohol, changing your life forever. However you came into these powers, you are one with direct and magical ties to alcoholic drinks.</p>

                <p>By 18th level, you’ve learned that there is no such thing as a wrong time to drink. As a bonus action on your turn, you may consume an alcoholic beverage to magically intoxicate yourself, crafted from magic through your own secret recipe. By spending 5 sorcery points, for 1 minute, or until you are reduced to 0 hit points or become incapacitated, while in this state of inebriation you gain the following effects:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your blurry vision gives you disadvantage on attack rolls, but your inebriated strength allows you to deal additional damage equal to half your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier, rounded down, should you land a hit.</li>
                    <li>You are confident in what you see, say, and think. You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.</li>
                    <li>Nothing is going to harm you. You’re sure of it. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</li>

            <p>By muttering arcane incantations backwards, you motion towards a target within range that is not an undead. The creature then begins to age forwards (rust if it is a construct) or backwards (deconstructs if it is a construct) in time for the duration and suffers from one of the following effects of your choice while moving through its own time:</p>
            <p class="indent">Physical Aging: The target suffers the effects of age and the progress of time on the body. The target has disadvantage on both Strength and Dexterity checks and saving throws due to an old body.</p>
            <p class="indent">Mental Aging: The target suffers the effects of age and the progress of time on the mind. The target has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and saving throws and has disadvantage on concentration checks to maintain spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">Physical Youth: The target suffers the effects of youth and the recession of time on the body. The target’s size counts as one size smaller, and damage caused by melee and ranged weapon attacks are reduced by half.</p>
            <p class="indent">Mental Youth: The target suffers the effects of youth and the recession of time on the mind. The target has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws and disadvantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.</p>
