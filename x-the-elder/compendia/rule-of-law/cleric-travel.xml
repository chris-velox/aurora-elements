            <p>Gods whose portfolios include the Travel domain—such as Desna, Avandra, Fharlanghn, and Hermes—are patrons of travelers and explorers, whether by sea or land. Travel gods send their priests wandering throughout the world as itinerant preachers, or as guides to those who travel the roads, rivers, wilds, and seas of the world. Followers of Travel gods worship at small roadside temples or self-made shrines at locations important to the traveller.</p>
