            <p>There is power in king’s blood. Whether a far flung cousin, the son of a deposed prince, or an unknown bastard, your lineage can be traced back to great kings and emperors. You might be totally unaware of your connection to a lost empire, or you are the last surviving heir of a deposed dynasty. Whatever your connection to your lineage, your bloodline has granted you powerful magical abilities.</p>

You also gain knowledge of the geography, people, and culture of your homeland, even if you have never been there, and learn the predominant native language if you don't already know it.</p>
