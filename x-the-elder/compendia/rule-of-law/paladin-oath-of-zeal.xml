            <p>The Oath of Zeal is a sworn vow to serve the church of their faith. Usually known by the moniker of Inquisitor, paladins who swear this oath devote their lives to rooting out enemies of their faith, using guile when righteousness is not an option. They sacrifice their own purity in order to cleanse those who defy their faith, and are willing to take extreme measures to achieve their goals.</p>

                <p>To the paladins that swear the Oath of Zeal, their long list of tenets are as important as their faith. The specifics vary based on the god that a paladin serves, but they all share the ideals of destroying the enemies of their church and of their god.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Root out Heresy.</em></strong> Wherever the enemies of my faith hide, I must hunt them down.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Heretics Must be Punished.</em></strong> There can be no mercy for those who will not repent.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>By Any Means.</em></strong> My qualms cannot get in the way of my duty to my faith.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Absolute Faith.</em></strong> I will never go against my church and my faith, and I will never attack those who are faithful.</p>

                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Stern Gaze.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can focus your mind on a particular creature, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. You have advantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws against that creature, and the target has disadvantage on Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws against you for 1 minute.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Unexpected Strike.</em></strong> You are exceptionally effective at getting the drop on heretics. When you hit a surprised creature with a melee attack, you can expend your Channel Divinity to make that attack a critical hit.</p>
