            <description>
                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speak No Evil.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of silence, using your Channel Divinity. Target creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become deafened and unable to make sounds for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the effect ends on the target.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Arcane Chains.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to manifest a pair of Clarified Lead braclets on an enemy. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 90 feet of you. The creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is grappled for one minute. When grappled in this way they are unable to cast spells that require a somatic component and any weapons they are holding(including natural) become nonmagical for the duration. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the braclets vanish.</p>

This barrier has an amount of hit points equal to twice your Paladin level + your Charisma modifier. Whenever a magical effect would deal damage to a creature within the barrier, the barrier takes damage instead. If damage would reduce the barrier to 0 hit points, any remaining damage is transferred to you, and the barrier dissipates.</p>
