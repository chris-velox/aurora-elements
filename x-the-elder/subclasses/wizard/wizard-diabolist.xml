            <p>Wizards that study diabology make masterful contracts with devils to deepen their arcane understanding. These wizards, known as diabolists, are either power hungry fools or shrewed legal geniuses. If a diabolist isn’t careful of the kinds of deals he makes, his soul will end up in the possession of one of the devils who served him in life.</p>
