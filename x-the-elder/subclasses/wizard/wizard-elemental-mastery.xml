            <p>Wizards of the tradition of Elemental Mastery focus their study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Elementalists blend principles of transmutation and evocation, focusing on the relationship between the elements and shaping them in more varied ways.</p>
