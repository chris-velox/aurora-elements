            <p>Glade Warrior The glade warrior is a rook of the sylvans; warriors who are the basis of grim fairy tales, reasons to not wander from home, and the awe-inspiring uncivilized people alike. They are gifted magical powers through the whispers, sounds, and chants of the fey they serve. For some, they have been called to soldier this way since birth, accustomed more towards their Archfey’s masters’ voices than their own parents; others, they are tricked, trapped, or beguiled into servitude. They are shrewd, the fey; scheming, intelligent, and carnal.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When you reach 3rd level, your trained martial ability is complemented with the power of fey whispers - words of magic. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.</p>
                <h5>Cantrips</h5>
                <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn an additional bard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <h5>Spell Slots</h5>
                <p>The Glade Warrior Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell bane and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bane using either slot.</p>
                <h5>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level bard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination and enchantment spells on the bard spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Glade Warrior Spellcasting table shows when you learn more bard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a divination or an enchantment spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the bard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the bard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a divination or an enchantment spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</p>
                <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells, since your spells come as power for you to command. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                </center>
