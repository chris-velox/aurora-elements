            <p>The archetypical Reaper is a battle-hardened warrior imbued with necrotic energy. Perhaps you survived a lich’s paralyzing touch, or suffered at the hands of an evil warlock. No matter how you obtained your dark powers, you can use them to empower your combat abilities.</p>

                <p>Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to curse a creature. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute, and you can only have one creature cursed at a time. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first time you would effect a cursed creature with a maneuver on each of your turns, the target takes necrotic damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>
                    <li>The creature does not gain advantage on attack rolls as a result of being hidden from you.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you reduce the cursed target to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + half your fighter level, which last for a minute.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">You can use this ability twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach 10th level, this feature can now be used three times, instead of twice, per short or long rest.</p>
