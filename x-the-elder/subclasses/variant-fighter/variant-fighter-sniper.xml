            <p>The archetypal Sniper uses distance to gain the upper hand in battle. Firing arrows or bolts from afar, each of the sniper’s shots is precise, calculated, and deadly. With a bow or crossbow in hand, nothing can hope to hide from them.</p>

                    <li>When you place a trap, you must place it in an empty space on the ground within 5 feet of you.</li>

                    <li>The trap triggers when a Small or larger creature moves into the trap’s space.</li>
                    <li>A trap lasts until it is triggered, but you can only have a maximum number of traps placed equal to your Dexterity modifier.</li>
                    <li>When you create the trap using your superiority option, the trap includes the additional effect described there.</li>
