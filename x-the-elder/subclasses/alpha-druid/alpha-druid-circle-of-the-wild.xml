                <p>Druids of the Circle of the Wild are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.</p>
                <p class="indent">Changeable as the weather, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth as a bear to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid’s blood.</p>

                <description>
                    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to magically assume the shape of different beasts. You gain access to five different types of shapes, though you decide how they look visually. You can use this feature twice and regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You stay in a beast shape until you use a bonus action on your turn to revert to humanoid form. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Increase, you may add that to each form. While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of a beast detailed on the next page, but you retain your alignment, personality, proficiency modifier (already added in the statblock for attacks, increase it with levels), skill proficiencies, saving throws, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You count as a shapeshifter.</li>
                        <li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>
                        <li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
                        <li>Your equipment merges into your new form and has no effect until you leave the form. If you equip equipment in a Beast Shape and leave the form, the item will disappear and appear equipped when you re-enter the form.</li>
                        <li>While you are transformed by Beast Shape, you can use a bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the spell slot expended.</li>
                    </ul>

When you enter a beast form you can choose one of the other benefits gained by a different form at 10th level, and gain that benefit as well.
