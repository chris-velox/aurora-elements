            <p class="flavor">Now, allow me to remind you why you so fear the dark.</p>
            <p>Dark and full of terros, it is not hard to understand why many evil gods hold the night as their domain. For them, the light is the home of weakness, to be snuffed out at every turn. Clerics to these deities spread fear of the night by embodying the most terrifying of nocturnal predators. Channeling the power of their gods, they can control the darkness, strike without warning, and, for those truly devoted, infiltrate the dreams of the unaware. For them, there is no greater success than when brazen adventurers travel into the dark, only to be swallowed by it whole, never to be seen again. Deities of this domain include Shar, Tharizdun, Takhisis, and Lolth.</p>
