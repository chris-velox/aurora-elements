            <p>The Winter domain embraces the harshest of the seasons, and acknowledges its place in the circle of the world. Winter domain deities promote the ideals of survival through the grating cold winds and fierce snowstorms, embracing the finality that comes with the end of a year, and a willingness to push through hardship into the following spring to come. Many different deities claim influence over this domain and their intentions and lessons may come very differently. Some embrace the harsh cold of winter and seek to spread its icy touch (such as Auril, Cailleach, and Boreas), while others promote the strength and power that comes only through the survival of the winter (such as the Raven Queen, Thrym, and Uller)</p>

As an action, you may unleash the howling winds of your deity. All enemies who can hear you within 60 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw, those within 10 feet of you do so with disadvantage. On a failure, enemies take 2d8 thunder damage and are deafened for 1 minute, those who fail within 10 feet take 3d8 thunder damage, are knocked 5 feet back, and fall prone. On a successful save enemies take half damage and are neither deafened or knocked prone.
