            <p>Gods of the pestilence domain are those with power over diseases, blights, and infestations. When crops fail, when rats devour the harvest, or when populations are decimated by disease, it is often the work of a god of pestilence. Gods of pestilence include Talona of the Forgotten Realms, Incabulos of Greyhawk, and Morgion of Dragonlance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Clerics of the pestilence domain are empowered by their god to go out and spread disease. They are capable of poisoning their foes and creating epidemics, all the while remaining immune to such afflictions themselves.</p>
