            <p>Gods of the Hearth are the patrons of all those who offer shelter to others. Followers of these gods are selfless individuals that put the comfort of their companions before all else. They seek to provide shelter to the weak, and bolster their allies. Hearth Clerics see themselves as the first line of defense against those that seek to destroy the warm, safe places of the world.</p>

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee weapon attack that deals bludgeoning damage (like a quarterstaff) you can choose to impose a special condition instead of killing them.</p>

This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or if you or your companions attack the creature, deal damage to it, or force it to make a saving throw.
