            <p>Not all priests are clerics. Not all problems can be solved by prayer and preaching. Sometimes a more subtle touch is needed to steer the world as the faith dictates, and that is the roll of a Divine Agent. A blade in the night that commits the lesser evil for the greater good, or a quick end to someone that sniffed too close the Cult of Vecnaâ€™s business, both could be the work of these divinely guided rogues.</p>
            <p class="indent">Good is not nice, evil is not stupid. Whatever the organization or god a Divine Agent serves, it is one that understands the practical nature of the world. Spying, stealing, extracting information, purging the heretics... they have many tasks before them, and complete them with a grim determination.</p>
            <p class="indent">A Divine Agent is almost always lawful following an organizational code with zealous focus, but the laws they follow may or may not have any relation to the laws of the land they are in.</p>

                <h5 class="caption">NAMING CONVENTION: INQUISITOR?</h5>
                <p>This archetype shares a lot of conceptual space with what many entries in the genre would call an "Inquisitor", but there already exists the "Inquisitive" rogue that lacks the divine backing present here, and having two archetypes with such similar names would ultimately cause confusion.</p>

            <p>The following are some optional quirks for a player of the Divine Agent to choose from. They can be preexisting when you make your character leading you to this path, or manifest as your character takes on this archetype.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>

                <tr><td>1</td><td>When you start talking passionately, your eyes begin to glow with zeal.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You burn the corpses of your fallen enemies. No exceptions.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>You recite a mantra to your deity during combat or times of peril</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You use the pronoun "we"... you and your god as act as one.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>You inscribe a prayer on your weapons to send off the departed.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You do not fear death. You believe your service will not end when your life does.</td></tr>
