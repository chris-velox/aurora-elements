            <p>When the gods need a heathen warlord silenced, a path scouted for a holy crusade, or a bridge lowered for warriors to gain access, they call upon their darting blades in the dark. They lay waste to the enemies dictated by their faith, even at the cost of their honour.</p>

                <p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn the message and minor illusion cantrips. You learn another cantrip of your choice from the cleric spell list at 10th level in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells.</i></b> You gain the ability to cast spells from the Sanctus Spells table. Once you reach the required level, you can cast the spells listed without expending a spell slot. If the spell requires material components, they don't for you. Once you cast a spell using this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">Alternatively, you can sacrifice the casting of one spell on the table to gain an additional casting of a Sanctus Spell of the same level. For example, you could sacrifice your casting of hunter's mark to cast zephyr strike twice.</p>
                <p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells, as they rely upon your insight into your targets.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

                <p>Beginning at 3rd level, your dedication leaks into the minds of your victims. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to mentally ask a question of the creature, which it must answer honestly. You can recite this answer perfectly as long as you have it memorised, regardless of whether you can speak the creature's language.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you must spend 1 minute in silent repose to separate your mind from that creature's last thoughts before you can do so again. Once you complete this ritual, you can't recite the previous answer as it becomes wiped from your memory.</p>
