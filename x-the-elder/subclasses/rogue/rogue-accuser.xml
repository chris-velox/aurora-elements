        <description>
            <p>Grim and determined inquisitors, the Accuser roots out the enemies of his faith, using trickery and guile when righteousness and purity is insufficient. Though Accusers have a fanatical dedication to their deity, they often consider themselves above the standard conventions of the church.</p>
            <p class="indent">Accusers are the assassins of the faith militant, wielding surprise and fear as their chief weapons against heretics, arcane and fiendish threats, and corruption within the church itself. They tend to move from place to place, hunting enemies of the faith or investigating mysteries both sacred and profane. As a result, they often join up with adventurers, if only to mask their presence and true aims.</p>
            <p class="indent">Not all gods have these followers, and it is not uncommon for an Accuser to belong to a secret splinter cult, or even be declared heretical by the main body of a deity’s worshipers.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you gain the power to proclaim your deity’s disfavor. As a bonus action, you impose one of the below sentences on a creature that you can see.</p>
            <p class="indent">A sentence lasts for one hour, or until you impose judgement on a different creature.</p>
            <h5>EXCOMMUNICATION</h5>
            <p>When the creature attacks a target within 30 feet of you, you can use a reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
            <h5>EXECUTION</h5>
            <p>When you deal damage to the creature with a cantrip, you can add your sneak attack dice to the damage roll if a weapon attack made under the same circumstances would fulfill the normal requirements for making a sneak attack.</p>
            <h5>EXORCISM</h5>
            <p>Your sneak attack deals radiant damage to the creature instead of it’s usual damage type, plus an additional 1d8 damage if the creature is a fiend or undead. A sentence lasts for one hour, or until you impose judgement on a different creature.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Also at 3rd level, you augment your inquisitorial prowess with magic granted by your deity, a pact made to further your divine mandate.</p>
            <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
            <p>You know the cantrip <i>sacred flame</i>, and one cantrip of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 9th and 15th level.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Accuser table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL OR HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know two 1st-level cleric spells of your choice, one of which you must choose from the Abjuration or Enchantment spells on the cleric spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Accuser table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an Abjuration or Enchantment spell, and must be no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. The spells you learn at 6th, 12th, and 18th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list, which must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and must be an Abjuration or Enchantment spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 6th, 12th, or 18th level.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier </p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 9th level, you can contemplate an ongoing investigation and potentially know whether your suspicions are valid.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can cast the spell <i>augury</i> without using a spell slot, except you get one of the following results in place of weal, woe, or weal and woe.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Correct.</b> If the hunch is the exact truth, such as if a particular individual is responsible for a crime, or if a particular organization is behind a series of events.</li>
                <li><b>Incorrect.</b> If the hunch is entirely off-base, such as if a suspect had nothing to do with a crime, or a suspected organization had no interest or hand in a series of events.</li>
                <li><b>Right track.</b> If the hunch is partially correct, such as if a suspect participated in a conspiracy or had foreknowledge of the crime in question, or if a suspected organization directly profited from and knew about but did not entirely orchestrate a series of events.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Using this ability repeatedly on the same mystery has similar effects to the overuse of augury; there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each hunch after the first that you get a random reading, no matter how much time has passed since.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you have finished a long rest.</p>
