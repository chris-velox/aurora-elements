            <p>Where most people avoid danger, there are some that seek it out at every opportunity. Daredevils are those that relish the change to risk their lives, either by attempting dangerous stunts or putting themselves in harms way. From young ages, daredevils would rather be maneuvering through treetops or leaping from roof to roof. Daredevils have a knack for avoiding what for most would be certain death.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a daredevil, what is it that drives you to perform these airborne feats of acrobatics? Is it a drive to push yourself to your absolute limits? The fame and attention it brings? Or just the adrenaline rush of risking life and limb?</p>

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</p>

The Spells Known column of the Magpie Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Druid spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Druid spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Druid spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

            <p>Where there is divine worship there are rules and laws, and for every organized religion there are those they consider heretics. Justicars are the secret hands of the church, operating in the shadows to snuff out heresy, dissent, and any that would work against the will of their god. They excel at neutralizing threats to their church. Often unacknowledged or flat out condemned by the magisterium, Justicars operate with ruthless dedication to see the will of their god enacted upon the world.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spell Slots.</em></strong> The Justicar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st-level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the spell wrathful smite and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast wrathful smite using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</em></strong> You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Paladin spell list. The Spells Known column of the Magpie Spellcasting table shows when you learn more Paladin spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Paladin spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Paladin spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting Ability.</em></strong> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells, since your power comes from your belief. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

            <p>At 9th level, your mastery of alchemical explosives allows you to alter your explosives in the following ways:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Appearance.</em></strong> You may alter the outward appearance of your explosives. When unlit, a creature must succeed on a successful Intelligence (Investigation) against your Explosive save DC to recognize them as explosives.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Damage Type.</em></strong> You may change the damage type of any explosive you craft to bludgeoning, piercing, fire, thunder, or lightning. This choice must be made when you craft your explosives at the end of a long rest.</p>
