        <description>
            <p>Trained in the arcane arts, a mage slayer targets those that abuse their talents. Their tactics involve disrupting spells that a caster might attempt to use, or restraining the spell slinger to prevent somatic components. Often times, a mage slayer is called upon from nobility to disable another warring kingdomâ€™s source of magic.</p>

            <p>Also at 3rd level, you have insight on how spellcasters protect their valuables. Whenever you make a successful Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Arcana) check on a magical trap or lock, you learn the following - the school of magic that radiates from the object, the spell level, and the effective range that will cause harm.</p>

            <description>
            <p>At 9th level, you can target the focus of a spellcaster and disrupt their concentration. When you make a melee or ranged attack on a target and have the benefits of a sneak attack, you can opt to remove the spellcasting focus out of their hand. If the attack hits, the spellcasting focus falls to the ground in front of the caster, and the concentration on their spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target does not take any damage from this attack. You may only use this feature once per round, and must use your sneak attack feature.</p>
