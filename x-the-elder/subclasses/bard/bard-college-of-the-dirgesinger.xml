            <p>Bards of the College of the Dirgesingers play tunes of melancholy and death in contrast to the pleasant music of most bards. Dirgesingers embrace death into their music and channel powers of the grave into their works. Dirgesingers sing the tales of Fallen Heroes, and of tragedies. A dirgesinger embraces the dark side of things.</p>

            <p>Beginning at 6th level, your songs call forth the dead. You learn the <i>animate dead</i> spell as a bard spell if you have not already and the spell does not count against the bard spells you know. Whenever you cast <i>animate dead</i> as a bard spell you may create one additional undead. All undead you create with the animate dead spell add {{necromancer:bonus}} to all their weapon attack rolls and gain a bonus to their melee weapon damage and spell attacks equal to your charisma modifier.</p>
