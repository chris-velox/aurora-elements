            <p>Witch Hunters are grim individuals often trained with crossbows or firearms who through holy power seek out corruption in order to bring it down. They often have varying motivations why they are apart of this archetype, could it be for vengeance, wealth or a religious cause. How they attain their divine aid also differs from person to person, but in its core it’s a tool to take out the wicked that plague the world.</p>
            <h5>WITCH HUNTER SPELLS</h5>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn the cantrip sacred flame, aswell as an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Witch Hunter Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p>
