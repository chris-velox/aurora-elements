        <description>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level when you choose this subclass, you gain a beast companion. This beast can be either an existing beast, or one summoned to you through a special ritual during a long rest, but upon becoming your companion, gains a magical bond with you that grants it special powers. Your beast can have the appearance of any beast CR 1 or lower, but it’s stats are determined by the stat block below and the traits selected.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can allocate a further two ability points to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution to your Companion’s ability scores. Your beast gains an additional two attribute points to allocate to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution any time you gain an Ability Score Improvement (your Companion has a maximum ability score of 20 for Strength, Dexterity, or Con, and 10 for Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). Your Companion’s proficiency is the same as yours and increases when your Proficiency does.</p>
            <p class="indent">The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command (no action required) the beast to move and to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action, or use your action to command it to take the Attack action.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your beast regains 6 + its Constitution modifier hit points every time you expend a hit die, and regains all its health at the end of a long rest. If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It does not require your command to use its reaction to make an opportunity attack. If you don’t issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your Companion dies, it can be revived by normal means (such as the <i>revivify</i> spell, or you can recall its spirit and cause it to reincarnate at the end of a long rest at full health.</p>
