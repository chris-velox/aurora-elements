            <p>Armed with ancient divine scriptures and modern arcane practices, Grim Wardens protect the world from the occult. They travel the land pursuing those who would abuse the weave with wicked intent, as well as the monstrous abominations that materialize from such abuse. These rangers often spend a great deal of time preparing for their hunts, as they are acutely aware of their physical limitations versus that of the monsters they face.</p>
