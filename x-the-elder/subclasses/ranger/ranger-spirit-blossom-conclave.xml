            <p>Rangers of the Spirit Blossom Conclave are cunning beings who channel dangerous fey magic. Unlike Fey Wanderers, who act as a bridge between the Feywild and the Material Plane, these rangers use their magic to fulfill their own goals, causing dangerous growths of fey plants to consume their foes, which they then aggitate, causing a blast of psychic energy.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, your attacks are infused with spiritual energy, allowing you to strike down your foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack on your turn, you can place a bloom mark on it, marking it for 1 minute or until you place a bloom mark on another creature. If you place a bloom mark on a creature that is already marked, you place an additional mark, up to a maximum of 3. When you hit a creature that has 3 bloom marks, you can consume all the bloom marks instead of marking it. If you do so, the attack deals an extra 3d10 psychic damage.</p>

                <p>At 7th level, your steps can't be hindered, and your stride can't be stopped. You can't be knocked prone while you're concious, and you ignore non-magical difficult terrain. Additionally, you can move across any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were solid ground (crossing molten lava can still cause you to take damage from the heat).</p>
