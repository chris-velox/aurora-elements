        <description>
            <p>A more rare discipline of wardens is that of light and dark. Fell Knights run a tightrope of balance between radiance and shadow, for fear they should fall into either side. Because of this, they have disciplined minds, and are often self-restrained individuals. However, there are also those of this practice that intentionally engulf one side, and are usually regarded as anomalies.</p>
