            <p>Through countless hours of meditation, monks of the Way of the Weave are able to form a connection to the Weave allowing them to will their ki into spells. These monks are known as Weavers, powerful practitioners of arcane magic who blend martial arts and spellcasting to devastating effect. Weavers specialize in the schools of divination and transmutation magic. Using divination magic to peer into the expansive knowledge of the Weave, and transmutation magic to alter their bodies and the world around them to meet any threat they may face. </p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you form a connection to the Weave allowing you to shape a portion of your Ki into spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. </p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Cantrips.</b> You learn three cantrips: true strike and two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level. </p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b> The Way of the Weave Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell feather fall and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast feather fall using either slot. </p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</b> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the divination and transmutation spells on the wizard spell list. </p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Way of the Weave Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st-level or higher. Each of these spells must be a divination or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. </p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. </p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you known with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learned your spells through deep meditation on the aspects of the Weave. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you can cast and when making an attack roll with one. </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack bonus</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

                <p>Beginning at 11th level, you learn to control the ebb and flow of magic directed toward you. You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the spell when you are hit by a ranged spell attack. If the spell has multiple ranged spell attacks, you can only deflect or catch one of them. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier + your monk level. </p>
                <p class="indent">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can seize control of the spell if you have at least one hand free. If you seize control of the spell in this way, you can spend 1 ki point per level of the spell seized (minimum of 1) to make a ranged spell attack with the spell, as part of the same reaction.
