            <p class="flavor">May I have this dance? Only those who can not hear the music shall think us to be insane. But... I suppose you’re free to do as you please. Come on already, if you’re coming.</p>
            <p class="indent">- Unknown girl at a tavern</p>
            <p>The Way of the Dancer teaches its students to move with the nimble, elegant steps of a dance. Their beautiful movements speak of martial discipline ─ of a pulsing, persistent energy whose rhythm can hearten souls and soothe troubled hearts. These alluring, graceful performers dance around the battlefield, deftly eluding enemies and inspiring allies. The dancer’s captivating, enchanting performances conceal a carefully executed sequence of blocks, parries, advances, attacks, and retreats, removing any who would obstruct the endless beat of the dance.</p>
            <p class="indent">A dancer often enjoys to put on shows for their allies and lighten the mood of the party. No matter where they may be, a dancer is ever ready to take the stage. Although a charming, thrilling ally, the dancer can be a frustrating, masterful foe.</p>
