            <p>Monks of the Way of the Geisha are dedicated to the traditional arts. They put their talents to use entertaining customers on the occasion of banquets and performances. Geisha are also skilled in the art of seduction, able to charm their patrons through conversation, song, and dance. A traveling geisha may enjoy pretending to be an innocent willow or an alluring flower, but in battle, a geisha's training and enchanting beauty transforms them into a fierce fighter.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to get into a person’s mind with a soft caress of the cheek. You can expend 1 ki point and use your bonus action to alluringly touch a creature within 5 feet of you. That target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Ki save DC. A creature that is immune to being charmed automatically succeeds on its saving throw. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on checks and saving throws it makes in response to your monk features or attacks. At the end of each of its turns, and each time you inflict damage to it, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. You must not have damaged this target for at least the past hour in order to target it with this feature.</p>
