            <p>Monks of the Way of the Force can manipulate the energy that exists within all things - which they call the Force - with their minds. Acolytes in the Way first learn how to move things about in the physical world; more learned masters who follow the Way can use their skill in the Force to manipulate the mind and even the soul.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you learn how to manipulate objects with your mind. You can cast the <em>mage hand</em> cantrip requiring no components, and the hand is invisible when you cast the cantrip with this feature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, as a bonus action, you can use your mind to hurl things short distances.

That creature or object must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be moved up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice, or knocked prone. A willing creature can choose to fail this saving throw. If you spend 1 ki point when you take this bonus action, a creature which fails the Strength saving throw is additionally restrained until the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent">Starting at 11th level, you can target creatures or objects up to two sizes larger than you.</p>

                <p>Starting at 17th level, your mastery of the Force allows you to project your spirit out of your body as an action. Your physical form falls unconscious, and your spirit form appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your physical form. Your spirit form retains all the features and ability scores that your physical form has, and also appears with spirit versions of any equipment your physical form was wearing or carrying when you used this ability. Your spirit form also gains the following benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your spirit form has a flying speed equal to its walking speed.</li>
                    <li>Your spirit form can pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, taking 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside a creature or object.</li>
                    <li>Your spirit form is resistant to all damage except psychic damage.</li>
                    <li>Any damage your spirit form deals is changed to force damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">Your spirit form and your physical form share hit points. Your spirit form disappears and this effect ends if you are reduced to 0 hit points, or after 1 minute has passed. Once this effect ends, your physical form returns to consciousness if you have at least 1 hit point.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
