            <p>The flowing monk moves as the waters and the winds move. They glide around their enemies, calm and composed, manipulating their foes’ aggression into weakness. Monks who follow this tradition learn to wait and listen, moving only when pushed or pulled by the tide of battle. In this way, a flowing monk sees order in the chaos of battle, sees peace in the violence.</p>

                <p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can enter a state of utter grace when threatened by danger, turning your opponents’ aggression against them or leading your allies out of harm’s way.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Defensive Dodge.</b> When you use your Patient Defense feature, you can enter a guarded stance until the start of your next turn. While in this stance, when a creature you can see within 5 feet of you attacks a target other than you, you can use your reaction to make a single unarmed strike against that creature.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Guiding Wind.</b> When you use your Step of the Wind feature, you can choose one willing creature within 5 feet of you that you can see. That creature can use its reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

                <p>At 6th level, you become adept at seizing the opportunities that come to you in battle. You have advantage on attack rolls you make on other creatures’ turns. If you hit a creature with an attack on another creature’s turn, you can cause the attack to deal extra damage to the creature equal to half your Monk level.</p>

                <p>When you reach 11th level, you gain the ability to react to multiple threats at once. When you take a reaction, you gain a second reaction that you can use before the start of your next turn. You can use this second reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short rest.</p>

                <p>At 17th level, you can follow the tide of battle wherever it may lead. Whenever you take a reaction, you can move up to half your speed and make a single unarmed strike as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
