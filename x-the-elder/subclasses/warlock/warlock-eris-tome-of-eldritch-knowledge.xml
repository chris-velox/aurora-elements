            <p>When you select this boon, you may spend a short rest creating an eldritch bond with a cloak that you are touching for the entire time. When completed, the cloak automatically attaches to your body, and cannot be removed from your body by any creatures other than you. While this bond exists, you may use a bonus action to teleport up to 30 ft. in any direction. You may use that feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and all expended uses are restored after completing a short or long rest.</p>

You gain the following benefits against that creature until the effect wears off:</p>

If you lose it, you can perform a ritual over the course of a short rest to get a new one. You can perform an hour-long ritual to give another magical mask the properties of your Pact Mask, in addition to the mask’s original properties. While you are wearing the mask, and a humanoid within 60 ft. of you that you can see is killed, you may use your reaction to steal its visage. While you have this creatures visage, you may use a bonus action to become that creature. While this is active, you are physically identical to it, your clothes become identical to the ones it was wearing when it died, you can perfectly mimic its voice, and you know everything about it except for its darkest secrets. The visage is non-illusionary, and you are actually physically changed by it. This effect lasts for 1 hour, or until you dispel it as a bonus action. After you have expended a visage, it is gone forever, and you cannot use this feature until you finish a long rest.</p>
