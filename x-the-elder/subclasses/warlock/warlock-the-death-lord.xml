            <p>Your powers were bestowed onto you by a powerful undead being such as a vampire lord or a Lich.</p>
            <h4>EXPANDED SPELLS</h4>
            <p>The necrotic blood flowing through you, give you additional spells which you automatically know when you have the required spell slot required to cast it. These spells work as warlock spells for you but do not count against the number of spells known.</p>
