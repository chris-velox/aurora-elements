                <p>At 14th level, you have been granted the art of conserving your energy to expend it all at one time. At the start of your turn, you can choose to hold your entire turn until your turn the next round. On your turn during the round after you use this ability, you can expend 1 warlock spell slot to hold your current turn and any previously held turns until your turn the next round. During this time, you cannot take reactions.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you choose to not use this feature and act on your turn, you must use all of your turns. When doing so, it is treated as taking the turns immediately after one another. For example, if this is the third round of combat and you have held your first turn and expended a spell slot to hold your second turn in addition, you have three turns to use. If you use your action and bonus action, then take another action, the movement from your first turn is gone, but you can still move as part of your second and third turns.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, after you take all of your turns held by this feature, you have a number of reactions equal to the turns held, until the start of your next turn.</p>
