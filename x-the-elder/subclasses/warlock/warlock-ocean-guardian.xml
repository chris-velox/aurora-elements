        <description>
            <p>Your patron is an Ocean Guardian, a mysterious and immortal entity of the ocean, associated with the elemental plane of water. They are immensely old and powerful, and often considered a noble in divine, fey, or elemental courts. They are a steward of the harmony and peace of the oceans, protecting sentient beings such as coastal residents, merfolk, sea elves, selkies, and tritons.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Ocean Guardian may also protect animals such as dolphins, whales, and sharks. Or they may preserve and defend ecosystems such as coral reefs and kelp forests. Appearing before mortals, they usually take the form of a sea creature, but may be much larger or much more otherworldly in some manner. They take many forms such as the form of a sea turtle rescuing a drowning sailor or a hippocampus guiding a ship safely through a storm.</p>
            <p class="indent">An Ocean Guardian will act as a patron for a warlock for a number of reasons. It could be to gather information on land, to defend nature, to fight against evil forces of the ocean, to stop murderous pirates, or to simply promote the greater good beyond its aquatic reach.</p>

                <h5 class="caption">Nature of the Ocean Guardian</h5>
                <p>An Ocean Guardian often serves the good or neutral deity of the ocean. However, the role of the Ocean Guardian is flexible to suit the backstory of your character and campaign. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They can serve a good ocean god such as Deep Sashelas in the Forgotten Realms.</li>
                    <li>For neutral ocean gods, such as Procam in Greyhawk, the Ocean Guardian can act as a champion of good in their realm.</li>
                    <li>The Ocean Guardian may instead be affiliated with gods of nature, protection, or duty. This can be the case especially if the ocean god is evil, like The Devourer in Eberron.</li>
                    <li>The Ocean Guardian can serve or act themselves as an elder elemental.</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, the Ocean Guardian can be an independent, unaffiliated entity. They may act as the good antithesis to krakens, leviathans, and other otherworldy horrors of the deep oceans.</li>
                </ul>
