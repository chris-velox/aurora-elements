            <p>At 1st level, your patron prepares you for the inevitable. You can cast contingency at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. When you do so, the spell lasts until you finish a short or long rest, and the contingent spell must be a warlock spell you know.</p>

            <p>Starting at 6th level, your patron leaves you no time to feel fear in the pursuit of your mission.

            <p>Starting at 14th level, you can spend 10 minutes talking to a crowd of people, recounting a vision foretold by your patron. Once the prophecy concludes, choose a number of creatures within 60 feet of you who listened to all of it (which can include yourself), up to a number equal to your Warlock level. A target is unaffected if it doesn't understand your language.</p>
            <p class="indent">The first time a target is reduced to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, it can use its reaction to take an action, before dying or falling unconscious.</p>
            <p class="indent">This effect ends on a target once it finishes a long rest, after which time it can benefit from this feature again.</p>
