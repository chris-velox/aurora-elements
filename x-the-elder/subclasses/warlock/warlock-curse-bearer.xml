            <p>You have made a pact with a mysterious godly spirit which has been cursed, but can still retain a little bit of its power to be granted to their devoted followersâ€” It can be manifested as an cursed fiend trapped in an evil sword, or sealed evil god in his prison plane, or Good Allignment God that been casted away after betrayed by other god. Example of famous patron from Curse Bearer could be Tharizdun or Vecna. Any fiend that been sealed, or any betrayer god that seek revenge is a good example. In exchange for your devotion, your patron grant you power to deliver deadly curse onto your enemy. This patron also grant protection to his devout followers to ensure that their followers can finish their task.</p>
            <p class="indent">The power granted by your patron didn't come without price. In exchange for that power, the follower of Curse-Bearer patron must obey his patron order, most of the patron have goals to free themself from the curse they bear. Some of them might seek revenge to the one who curse/imprison them at the first place.</p>
