            <p>You made a pact with a powerful being, perhaps one that was beyond your understanding. The pact set terms for the exchange of powers, conditions that had to be met. Whether by your choice or your patron's, the terms were broken and the pact is no more. Your patron no longer actively issues you power. In fact, your patron may even be spiteful and actively trying to hinder your efforts.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless, the issuing of a pact is an eldritch contract beyond comprehension, and its formation leaves the humanoid vessel changed. Despite the destruction of your pact, you find yourself imbued with a new and different set of power.</p>

                <p>The Pactbreaker loses previously learned patron spells. However, in order to protect yourself from your former patron and the influence of others, you can choose to learn spells from an expanded list of spells. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you and you may choose them to replace any spells lost when your pact was broken or when you gain a level in this class.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 1st level, you have learned the harsh truths of subordination and know how to corrupt such relationships. As an action, you can force a creature you can see within 30 feet to make a Wisdom saving throw if its CR is less than that of one of its allies within 120 feet. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened of the higher CR ally and cannot willingly use its turn to aid the ally toward its obvious goals, like protecting itself or defeating its enemies. If there are multiple creatures with higher challenge ratings within range, you may choose the creature to be frightened of. If the creature is allied with no creatures of higher CR, this feature automatically fails and you regain your use of this feature.</p>
                <p class="indent">The frightened creature remains so until it takes damage, it uses its action to succeed on the saving throw, or the higher CR creature is incapacitated.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 6th level, you can become a guiding light to those who've broken their bonds but fear the repercussions of doing so. As an action, you can cause a frightened creature of CR 1 or lower to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature joins you as an ally and gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. In combat, the creature rolls its own initiative, but it obeys your verbal commands (no action required), and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0). On a success, the creature is immune to this feature for 24 hours.</p>
                <p class="indent">You may have one such creature in your service at a time. It remains in your service until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until this effect is ended by a greater restoration or other similar magic, or until the end of your next long rest, at which point it sets out on a new life. If this effect ends before you take a long rest, the creature makes a new Wisdom saving throw. On a success, it may choose to become hostile. On a failure, it sets out on a new life peacefully.</p>
                <p class="indent">The CR creatures you can affect increases as you gain levels in this class to CR 2 at 10th level, CR 3 at 14th level, and CR 4 at 18th level.</p>
