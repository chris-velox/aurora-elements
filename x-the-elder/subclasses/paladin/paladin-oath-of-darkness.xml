            <p>Paladins of the Oath of Darkness are often viewed as dark and sinister. Detached from society and the quarrels of mortals, they are a rare sight to behold and are seen as ill omens of impending destruction. However, most of those who follow the tenets of this oath do so to protect those who cannot fight against the uncanny, sacrificing the chance at a normal life to champion a greater cause. These paladins are sometimes called dusk knights, or ebonguard, and use the shadows to protect the world from the unearthly forces of evil.</p>

                <p>The tenets of the Oath of Darkness vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around the realisation of the paladinâ€™s inner dark self, and using that power to protect civilization from the shadows.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Protect the Innocent.</em></strong> Use the darkness to protect the souls of mortals.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Embrace the Darkness.</em></strong> You need to understand the darkness within you to be able to navigate the darkness of the world with merit.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Purge the Unholy.</em></strong> You are the barrier between this world and the next. Anything that wants to go against the natural order of things, must pass through your blade.</p>
