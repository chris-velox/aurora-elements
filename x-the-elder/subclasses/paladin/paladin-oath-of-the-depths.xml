            <p>Those that follow this Oath believe in finding the true secrets that dwell not only within the sea, but also on land. At times called Blue Knights or Deep Knights, these paladins exist to help pave the way for those who carry light to spread it where only darkness would once reside.</p>

                <p>When you take this Oath at 3rd level, you gain the two following channel divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sea’s Grasp:</em></strong> As an action, you can invoke the call of the sea to unleash the primordial forces of the deep. Creatures within a 10ft radius sphere centered on a point within 30ft of you must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be grappled for the duration. While restrained, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Aquatic Explorer:</em></strong> You may use your channel divinity as an action to embrace the freedom provided by sea. After using this action, your body adapts to the depths of the sea providing you a 40ft swim speed and the ability to speak and breath underwater for 1 hour.</p>
