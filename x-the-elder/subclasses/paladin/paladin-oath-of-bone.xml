            <p>Paladins of Bone refuse to submit to fear, inspiring it in their opponents instead. Often, these paladins make their oath with the ideal of power and glory, refusing to give up.</p>
            <p class="indent">Paladins of Bone are notorious for their inability to stay dead.</p>

                <p>Paladins of Bone are bringers of fear and testaments of Azisharn’s will.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When a Paladin of Bone accomplishes a great victory, it is customary to take a trophy. Many will adorn mammoth tusks and dragon skulls, but it is not uncommon to find a Paladin of Bone who will carry etchings or momentos of fallen companions on their armour and weapons.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, as a Paladin of Bone becomes familiar with a weapon or piece of armour, it will tend to take on bone like qualities.</p>

                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Bone Armour.</i></b> You can use your Channel Divinity to cover your skin with a layer of bone. As an action, you harden your skin to the strength of steel. You gain a +2 bonus to AC. This effect lasts a minute unless dismissed.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Terrifying Aspect.</i></b> As an action, the paladin channels the darkest emotions and focuses them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of the paladin’s choice within 30 feet of the paladin must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see the paladin. On a failed save, the target is frightened of the paladin for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the paladin, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.</p>
