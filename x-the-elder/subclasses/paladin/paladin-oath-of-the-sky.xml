            <p>The Oath of the Sky calls to paladins who wish to see a free world where tyranny and oppression are replaced by equity. They typically find themselves as guardians of communities that share their beliefs and have historically served as the vanguard for liberation fonts. Often called skywarderns and partnering with sentient creatures of the skies, these paladins will always be ready to act against any sign of corruption.</p>

                <p>The tenets of the Oath of the Sky vary by paladin as do the views on life and the mystery of free will, but they generally share these beliefs.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Liberty.</em></strong> Your actions champion the preservation of choice and free will. Impose law only to protect the freedom of others.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Courage.</em></strong> In times of crisis, you are the first one to act, and always protect the ones unable to fight.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Vigilance.</em></strong> You are always alert and ready to root out and hunt down oppressors.</p>

                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Sacred Shots.</em></strong> You can use your Channel divinity to imbue one ranged weapon you are holding with divine energy as a bonus action. For the next hour the weapon becomes magical if it isn’t already and when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack using this weapon, you can use your Divine Smite feature as if it were a melee weapon attack.</p>
                <p class="indent">Starting at 11th level, the Improved Divine Smite feature also affects ranged weapon attacks made with a weapon under the effects of your Sacred Shots, as if they were melee weapon attacks.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Guided Query.</em></strong> You can use your Channel Divinity to augment your attempts at revealing the hidden. When you make an Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Insight), Wisdom (Perception) or a Wisdom (Survival) check, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the GM says whether the check succeeds or fails.</p>
