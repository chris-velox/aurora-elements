            <p>The Oath of Cleansing is followed by those who are willing to burn their enemies and grow allies from the ashes that are left behind. Called the Ash Knights, these paladins burn those found unclean and raise from the ash those who they deem to be worthy making them one of the most infamous orders.</p>

                <p>When you take this Oath at 3rd level, you gain the two following channel divinity options.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Flame’s Judgement:</em></strong> As an action, you can call upon the flames of truth to exorcise the filth of a soul belonging to one creature within 30 ft of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or suffer 2d10 + your paladin level in fire damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful save.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Pyre of Cleansing:</em></strong> You may use your channel divinity as an action and inspire health and growth in those around you. All allied creatures within 30ft of you are cured of any effect that would cause them to be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or blinded.</p>

In addition, whenever you reduce an enemy to 0 hitpoints all allies within your aura regain hit points equal to your charisma modifer. At 18th level this range increases to 30 feet.</p>
