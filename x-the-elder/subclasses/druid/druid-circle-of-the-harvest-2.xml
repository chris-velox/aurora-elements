			<p>Druids of the Circle of the Harvest are sowers and reapers. They believe that in order for life to flourish, it must be culled when it becomes overgrown or rotten. These druids see little difference between taking a life and trimming a plant, or saving a life and planting a seed. As a harvest druid, it is all part of your hallowed duty to preserve the balance of nature.</p>

				<p>Starting at 2nd level, your cricle grants you a scythe--a symbol of your sacred purpose. Your scythe is a martial melee weapon with the two-handed and reach properties that deals 1d10 slashing damage on a hit. You are proficient with it and it can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>
				<p class="indent">If your scythe is lost or destroyed, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to retrieve it.</p>

				<p>Also at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action and expend one use of your Wild Shape to assume reaper form. When you do, you gain the following benefits for 10 minutes or until you are incapacitated:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Twilight Veil.</b> Shadows envelop you like a hooded cloak. Bright light or darkness within 10 feet of you becomes dim light. When you or a creature within 10 feet of you is the target of an attack, you can use your reaction to shift these shadows, imposing disadvantage on the attack roll.</li>
					<li><b>Dread Culling.</b> Attacks with your scythe are considered magical, and you can use your Wisdom modifier for attack and damage rolls with it. The first creature you hit with your scythe on each of your turns takes extra necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + half your druid level, and you or one creature within 30 feet of you gains temporary hit points equal to the extra damage dealt.</li>
