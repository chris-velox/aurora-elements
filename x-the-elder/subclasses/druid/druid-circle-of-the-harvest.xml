They are 3 inches in height, are able to carry up to 10 pounds in weight, have a movement speed equal to your own movement speed and you can telepathically communicate with your harvest sprites. Harvest sprites can convey basic information back to you (feelings/denial/confirmation) and are able to convey simple messages (one sentence). You can use your action to cause your harvest sprites to deliver your touch spells as long as that spell does not cause direct damage. This will cause the harvest sprite that used the spell to disappear.

            <description>
                <p>At 14th level, you have ascended to a higher form of power. The well of natural energy within you has given birth to a new demiplane of your own design. This takes form as a field 300 ft squared surrounded by impassable hills with a two-story wooden cottage in the field although this is up to the player’s discretion as long as no features within cause damage. Inside you can instantaneously grow any food-bearing plants that provide full sustenance for any who eat the fruit and you can create any non-magical object that you have seen before that fits within the homestead but it cannot cause damage and you can replicate any sort of weather that you have seen. You spend 10 minutes gathering nature’s energy into yourself and form the pocket dimension outside of which takes the form of a translucent sphere about 5 feet in diameter. Only people you choose can see the entrance; those who you do not allow must make a Perception check against your spell save DC to perceive the entrance; those who fail cannot see or interact with it and if their passive perception is higher than your spell save DC they can see the entrance automatically. Creatures my repeat this saving throw each day. When a hostile creature attempts to enter they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, on a failure you become alerted to their presence and can discern where they are while in the homestead and cannot be hidden by magical means bar a wish spell. You can as an action you can attempt to banish any creature within your homestead, this targeted creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or immediately be banished outside your homestead for the duration of your current homestead. This lasts for 12 hours.</p>
