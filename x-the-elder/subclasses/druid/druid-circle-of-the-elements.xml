            <p>Druids of the Circle of the Elements are wielders of powerful and dangerous magics. This order recognizes that nature is not only the beasts and plants of the world, it is also the elemental forces that shape the world itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tapping into magic drawn from the Elemental Planes of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, these druids bring the raw uncontained fury of the elements to bear against their foes.</p>

                <p>Also at 2nd level, when you use your Wild Shape feature, you can channel an element through yourself, rather than transforming.</p>
                <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your Druid level, and must choose fire, water, air, or earth for an additional benefit. You may not channel the same element twice until you have completed a short rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fire.</em></strong> Any spells you cast that deal fire damage deal additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. In addition, when you roll fire damage for a spell, you can reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one). You take 1d4 fire damage for each die you choose to reroll.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Water.</em></strong> When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals cold damage or conjures water (such as tidal wave), you regain a number of hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Air.</em></strong> Your speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, anytime you move a creature against its will using a spell, that creature takes lightning damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Earth.</em></strong> Your AC increases by 2, and any spells you cast that deal bludgeoning damage deal additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>
                <p class="indent">These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you become incapacitiated, or until you use your Wild Shape again.</p>

                <p>The flow of the elements through you grants you access to certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Elements Spells table.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>
