                <p>At 1st level, the Sign of the Crown grants you the power to mystically inspire your allies to swift maneuvers and firm endurance. As a bonus action, you can issue a command to a friendly creature other than yourself that is within 30 feet of you and can see or hear you.

                <p>At 14th level, the stars bestow upon you the cosmic right of rule, and your very voice reverberates with that authority. You can choose for your voice to be up to three times louder than normal whenever you say anything.</p>

On a failed save, a creature takes 5d12 thunder damage and must stand at attention. Until the end of its next turn, its movement speed becomes 0, and it is incapacitated.

            <p>You make yourself seem mighty and awe-inspiring to certain creatures, filling them with reverential terror. Each creature in a 10-foot cube within range must make a Charisma saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it can't see you. On a failed save, a target must kneel, becoming prone, and it can't stand for the duration. A creature affected by this spell can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
