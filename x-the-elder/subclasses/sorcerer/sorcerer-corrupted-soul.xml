                <p>Your natural magic seems to have mixed with the demonic source you are bound to. Sorcerers with this origin add the <em>eldritch blast</em> cantrip to their list of known cantrips.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, you can replace a metamagic option you choose with a Warlock invocation of your choice, for which you have no warlock levels in prerequisites and must follow all other invocation rules. You cannot have more invocations than you do metamagic. You find you are able to control it to some degree, but often suffer terrible consequences when doing so. When you cast a Corrupted Origin spell, or cast a spell of 1st level or higher using one of your Warlock Invocations, roll on the Dark Reckoning table.</p>

                <p>There is some small advantage to embracing your darkness. Any time you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you may choose to tap into into the power being leeched from your dark passenger. If you choose to do so, roll on the Dark Blessing table and the Dark Reckoning table, taking the result of each seperately. You can use this Dark Blessing feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

                <p>Starting at 6th level, you can siphon off some portion of this dark entity's power to a nearby creature. Whenever a creature other than yourself within 30 feet of you casts a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your reaction and spend 1 sorcery point to force them to roll on your choice of either the Dark Blessing or Dark Reckoning table.

When you roll damage for a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you may spend a number of hit dice up to your Charisma modifier. You and any targets of the spell take psychic damage equal to the numbers rolled. You can use this feature only once per long rest.</p>
