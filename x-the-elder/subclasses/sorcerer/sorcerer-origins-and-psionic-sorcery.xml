            <h4>GENASI BLOODLINES</h4>
            <p>Those who think of other planes at all consider them distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth or the whim of a Genie, carry the power of the planes in their blood. Sorcerers of Genasi Bloodlines are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.</p>
            <p class="indent">Occasionally, genasi sorcerers result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">GENASI, RACE OR SORCEROUS ORIGIN?</h5>
                <p>I love the idea of player characters and NPCs with ties to the elemental planes, or as descendents of Genies. However, I never felt that genasi made sense as a player character race. To me, they always seemed like a type of sorcerer.</p>
                <p class="indent">Much like the Draconic Bloodline Sorcerous Origin, I think switching genasi to a sorcerer subclass makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. A dwarven Stoneblood sorcerer or a human Emberheart sorcerer seemed more flavorful and fitting then just an earth genasi or a fire genasi. Especially considering the official lore from Wizards of the Coast for genasi in 5th edition.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>EMBERHEART</h4>
            <p>As an Emberheart sorcerer, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the Efreeti. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it. Nearly all Emberheart sorcerers, also known as fire genasi, are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal- black, or ash-gray skin tones.</p>
            <p class="indent">How does your flaming soul effect your decisions? Are you a raging inferno, unable to be controlled? Or, do you resist the urges of your bloodline, seeking to master your power?</p>

            <p>At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature. The following options are available to a sorcerer, in addition to those offered in the Player’s Handbook: The Genasi Bloodlines: Emberheart, Stoneblood, Stormsoul, and Waveborn, and the bloodline of Dwarven royalty, the Runebrand.</p>

You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. Your blood calls you to avoid rash decisions, pausing to consider your options before acting.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature. The following options are available to a sorcerer, in addition to those offered in the Player’s Handbook: The Genasi Bloodlines: Emberheart, Stoneblood, Stormsoul, and Waveborn, and the bloodline of Dwarven royalty, the Runebrand.</p>
            <h4>GENASI BLOODLINES</h4>
            <p>Those who think of other planes at all consider them distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth or the whim of a Genie, carry the power of the planes in their blood. Sorcerers of Genasi Bloodlines are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.</p>
            <p class="indent">Occasionally, genasi sorcerers result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">GENASI, RACE OR SORCEROUS ORIGIN?</h5>
                <p>I love the idea of player characters and NPCs with ties to the elemental planes, or as descendents of Genies. However, I never felt that genasi made sense as a player character race. To me, they always seemed like a type of sorcerer.</p>
                <p class="indent">Much like the Draconic Bloodline Sorcerous Origin, I think switching genasi to a sorcerer subclass makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. A dwarven Stoneblood sorcerer or a human Emberheart sorcerer seemed more flavorful and fitting then just an earth genasi or a fire genasi. Especially considering the official lore from Wizards of the Coast for genasi in 5th edition.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>STORMSOUL</h4>
            <p>As a Stormsoul Sorcerer, or air genasi, you are descended from the Djinni. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long. Your blood drives you to be fleeting like the wind, never staying in one place for too long.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 1st level, a sorcerer gains the Sorcerous Origin feature. The following options are available to a sorcerer, in addition to those offered in the Player’s Handbook: The Genasi Bloodlines: Emberheart, Stoneblood, Stormsoul, and Waveborn, and the bloodline of Dwarven royalty, the Runebrand.</p>
            <h4>GENASI BLOODLINES</h4>
            <p>Those who think of other planes at all consider them distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth or the whim of a Genie, carry the power of the planes in their blood. Sorcerers of Genasi Bloodlines are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.</p>
            <p class="indent">Occasionally, genasi sorcerers result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">GENASI, RACE OR SORCEROUS ORIGIN?</h5>
                <p>I love the idea of player characters and NPCs with ties to the elemental planes, or as descendents of Genies. However, I never felt that genasi made sense as a player character race. To me, they always seemed like a type of sorcerer.</p>
                <p class="indent">Much like the Draconic Bloodline Sorcerous Origin, I think switching genasi to a sorcerer subclass makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. A dwarven Stoneblood sorcerer or a human Emberheart sorcerer seemed more flavorful and fitting then just an earth genasi or a fire genasi. Especially considering the official lore from Wizards of the Coast for genasi in 5th edition.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>RUNEBRAND</h4>
            <p>Once a generation the heads of the seven dwarven clans gather to select a new king. This process is lengthy and often takes years to reach a decision, but when the new king is selected he undergoes a secret ceremony, imbuing his soul with the divine blessing of rulership.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a Runebrand sorcerer, you are destined to rule over dwarvenkind. You have been granted great power, but with that power comes responsibility. Will you live up to expectations and look to lead the dwarves into a new golden age?</p>

                <p>Psionics hold a unique spot in Dungeons & Dragons and is a critical part of one of the most iconic monsters; the Illithid. However, there has never been a satifying option for playing a fully-fledged psionic character in 5th edition.</p>
                <p class="indent">With some adjustments, I believe the sorcerer class is the best way to bring this type of player character to life. To have the flavor fully match the mechanics of a psionic character, talk to your Dungeon Master about using the following optional rules (or use my Alternate Sorcerer).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Intelligence Spellcasting:</b><br/>Change your saving throw proficiency, Spellcasting ability, Multiclassing prerequisites, and any other mentions of Charisma in the Sorcerer class description with Intelligence.</li>
                    <li><b>Psionic Origin Spells:</b><br/>One of the main drawbacks of the sorcerer is the small amount of spells known. Adding a list of Origin Spells, flavorful & thematic spells that you automatically learn at certain levels, can go a long way to enhancing your psionic character.</li>
                    <li><b>Psionic Sorcery:</b><br/>At 6th level, you gain the optional feature, Psionic Sorcery which lets you cast spells without V,S,M components.</li>
                    <li><b>Spell Point Casting Variant:</b><br/>Use the Variant: Spell Points rule from page 288 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Spell points allow for more flexibility for the caster, and better simulate psionic mental resources. Just make sure to limit the number of spells of 6th-level and higher you can cast per day.</li>

                    <li><b>Spell Point Casting Variant:</b><br/>Use the Variant: Spell Points rule from page 288 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Spell points allow for more flexibility for the caster, and better simulate psionic mental resources. Just make sure to limit the number of spells of 6th-level and higher you can cast per day.</li>

            <p>One day a light blazed forth within you, the illumination of psionic power. Your mind now simmers with this power, the full extent of which you won’t fully grasp for years to come. You can touch other minds with it and alter the world around you by using it to control the magical energy of the multiverse. Will this power shine from you as a hopeful beacon to others? Or will you be a source of terror to those who feel the stab of your mind and witness the strange manifestations of your might?</p>

                <p>Psionics hold a unique spot in Dungeons & Dragons and is a critical part of one of the most iconic monsters; the Illithid. However, there has never been a satifying option for playing a fully-fledged psionic character in 5th edition.</p>
                <p class="indent">With some adjustments, I believe the sorcerer class is the best way to bring this type of player character to life. To have the flavor fully match the mechanics of a psionic character, talk to your Dungeon Master about using the following optional rules (or use my Alternate Sorcerer).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Intelligence Spellcasting:</b><br/>Change your saving throw proficiency, Spellcasting ability, Multiclassing prerequisites, and any other mentions of Charisma in the Sorcerer class description with Intelligence.</li>
                    <li><b>Psionic Origin Spells:</b><br/>One of the main drawbacks of the sorcerer is the small amount of spells known. Adding a list of Origin Spells, flavorful & thematic spells that you automatically learn at certain levels, can go a long way to enhancing your psionic character.</li>
                    <li><b>Psionic Sorcery:</b><br/>At 6th level, you gain the optional feature, Psionic Sorcery which lets you cast spells without V,S,M components.</li>
                    <li><b>Spell Point Casting Variant:</b><br/>Use the Variant: Spell Points rule from page 288 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Spell points allow for more flexibility for the caster, and better simulate psionic mental resources. Just make sure to limit the number of spells of 6th-level and higher you can cast per day.</li>
