            <p>You hail from a long line of oracles, once gifted with the spark of magic to help guide the living and the dead of the world who lost their path. Though able to do magic of all kind, your ancestors perfected their powers to see the future in ways a commoner couldn’t even dream of. Through con­cen­tra­tion you can see all parallel timelines and every possibility of an individual’s every move, aiding you in combat and in society.</p>

            <p>The very magic in your bloodline grants you access to an expanded list of spells. Any spell that might require a god or otherworldly being, you contact the spirits of the Ethereal realm instead. They answer normally as the entity would, though their knowledge might be more limited than a god’s (DM’s choice). The following spells are added to the sorcerer spell list for you.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, you gain insight into your enemy’s next move. If a hostile creature makes a weapon attack against you, you may use your reaction to roll 1d4 and subtract it from the total attack roll. If the attack misses you, the attacker can’t make opportunity attacks against you until the start of your next turn. At 14th level, the rolled die changes to 2d4.</p>
