            <p>You wield the whimsical power of the Feywild, a mystical land where logic and reason matter less than chaos and emotion. Every breath molds creation and a simple thought by some of its inhabitants can change the world. You've learned to draw on this wondrous and often terrible place. With blade in hand, you strike at foes too distracted to defend themselves. With weapon sheathed, you know your tongue is as sharp as any blade. And if those fail, you at least know how to get away more or less unscathed.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Beginning at 3rd level, you've learned to weave illusions and enchantments within your blows for deadly effect. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>You learn the druidcraft cantrip. Additionally, you learn two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list. You learn an additional cantrip at 10th level.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Fey Knight table Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the illusion and enchantment spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Fey Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an illusion or enchantment spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an illusion or enchantment spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells, since you cast them by channeling your emotions and will. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                </center>

            <description>
                <p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
