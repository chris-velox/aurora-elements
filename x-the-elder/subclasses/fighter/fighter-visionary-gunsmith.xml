            <p>A Visionary Gunsmith uses their creative mind to design their own shooters. To them, combat is a testing ground and an opportunity to show off their deadly toys. When they are not in battle, they can often be found tinkering at a workbench or polishing their crossbow. They can be ready for anything, given they have a little inspiration and a loaded gun.</p>

            <h4>QUICK CUSTOMIZATION</h4>
            <p>There are roughly four million possible prototypes you can build, but you can customize one quickly by following these suggestions. First, choose a weapon based on your campaign setting. Ask your DM about what is and isn’t allowed. Second, roll a d20 a number of times equal to your maximum number of enhancements to determine which ones you add. Reroll if there is a repeat or if you don’t have the prerequisite materials. The enhancements are assigned in alphabetical order (see list). Third, to determine which enhancement(s) you upgrade, refer to the ones you’ve added and roll based on your level:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Levels 3-6:</b> Roll a d4, assigning each enhancement to a pair of numbers.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Levels 7-9:</b> Roll a d6, assigning each enhancement to a pair numbers.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Levels 10-14:</b> Roll a d8, and then a d6, assigning each enhancement to a pair of numbers for each roll.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Levels 15-20:</b> Roll a d10, a d8, and then a d6, assigning each enhancement to a pair of numbers for each roll.</p>        </description>
