            <p>The Templar is a fighter under the servitude of a god or deity. Similar to a Paladin, these Fighters have the ability to cast holy spells and invoke their god’s wrath upon any who appose them.</p>
            <p class="indent">This Archetype serves as a more holy alternative to the Eldritch Knight. Sometimes you want to play a holy knight or healing warrior without being forced into being a Paladin.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the cleric spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Templar Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the cleric spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Templar Spellcasting table shows when you learn more cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the cleric spells you know with another spell of your choice from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

                <p class="indent">By performing a minute-long ritual on the remains of a creature that has been dead for no more than 7 days and hasn’t been targeted by this feature before, you can learn its cause of death. If the creature was killed by another creature, you can also learn details about the creature’s killer by making a Wisdom (Insight) check with a DC equal to the killer’s passive Charisma (Deception) score. You automatically fail this check if the killer is protected from divination magic, such as through the nondetection spell. On a success, you learn the killer’s creature type, and the distance and direction to their location as of the completion of the ritual. On a failed check, the killer knows that divination magic was attempted on it, but it doesn’t know its source.</p>
                <p class="indent">The DM might allow you to use this feature to investigate events other than deaths. For example, scenes of a recent robbery or evidence of an assault might be viable targets for this Channel Divinity, at your DM’s discretion. In these cases, you would discover information about the main perpetrator of that event, rather than a “killer.”</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash the cleansing light of your deity in a series of furious, radiant strikes, by using your action and your Channel Divinity. When you do, you perform the Wax phase listed below. After performing a phase, you can perform the next phase in the series on your subsequent turn by using your action. If you do not, or if you’ve performed all four phases, the cycle ends.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wax. You unleash a cleaving crescent blast of radiant energy in a line up to 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, ending with a burst in a 10-foot radius sphere at the end of the line. Creatures within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. If a creature fails, it takes radiant damage equal to 1d10 + your cleric level, or half as much damage on a success.</li>
                    <li>Full. You shield yourself with moonlight, gaining temporary hit points equal to your cleric level that last for one minute. If damage from a creature causes you to lose any of these temporary hit points, that creature takes radiant damage equal to the temporary hit points lost.</li>
                    <li>Wane. You teleport up to 30 feet in a burst of moonlight to a location you can see within 5 feet of another creature, and can immediately cast a cleric cantrip targeting that creature as part of the same action.</li>
                    <li>Eclipse. You call down a scorching blast of radiant energy. Each hostile creature within 15 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. If a creature fails, it takes radiant damage equal to 1d10 + twice your cleric level, or half as much damage on a success.</li>
