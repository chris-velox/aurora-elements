        <description>
            <p>Fae knights are warriors blessed or cursed by a particular group of fey creature. This boon grants supernatural powers, but always comes with a price.</p>
            <p class="indent">Fae knights that receive the gift of a nymph receive her incredible attractiveness. In return, she demands that you protect the beauty of the world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Prerequisite: Although nymphs mean well, they are somewhat superficial, and they only give their gift to individuals they already consider attractive. You must have a Charisma score of at least 14 to take this subclass.</p>
