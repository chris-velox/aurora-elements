            <p>Warriors of the wildnerness, Slayers specialize in hunting monsters that threaten the edges of civilization-humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Slayers focus their combat training on identifying a foe’s weakness to exploit its vulnerabilities.</p>

                <h5>SPELL-LESS RANGER REIMAGINED</h5>
                <p>After viewing different attempts online, I decided a spell less ranger is much more limited than its magical counterpart and could easily be a rogue or fighter subclass. We already have the Scout rogue, which focuses on a nimble ambusher, but what about the more sturdy rangers like Aragorn, Drizzt, or Goblin Slayer that don’t fit as rogues? These "rangers" are warriors first and foremost, and this fighter archetype is here to emulate that fantasy.</p>
                <p class="indent">I followed the Cavalier and Samurai model in rewarding extra proficiencies but also giving limited resources to the fighter in the form of Slayer’s Mark (Hunter’s Mark). Boiling down many possible ranger features into one subclass was difficult, but I focused on the core theme: a warrior comfortable in the wilderness and expert at slaying monsters.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can focus your attention on one foe, increasing the harm you can inflict on it. As a bonus action, you designate one creature you can see within 60 feet of you as the target of this feature. You deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. This feature lasts for 1 hour.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
