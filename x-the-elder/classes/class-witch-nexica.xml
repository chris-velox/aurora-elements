        <description>
            <p>Cornered by the enemies, a young elf is looking for a way to escape her terrible situation. Suddenly, a large beast-like creature jumps in front of her, ready to defend her.</p>
            <p class="indent">In the shady ally of a major city, screams can be heard as a human finishes off one of his targets. "He won’t disrupt the balance of the universe anymore," thought the assassin.</p>
            <p class="indent">Between a feverish little girl and her parents, an old gnomish figure is making the young girl drink a strange blue and purple liquid contained in a small vial.</p>
            <p class="indent">Witches are the worshippers and protectors of magic. They can manipulate the arcane and divine forces of the world around them to help others or to destroy the obstacles in front of them.</p>
            <h4>TRUE MAGIC</h4>
            <p>For witches, magic is the essence of the world. Arcane or divine, it is present in every single object, person, phenomenon, act and thought. Some people have learned to use its power by bending it and forcing it to oblige to their wants, but the magic wielded by witches is much more fluid. It flows through them in a much more primal state. It is an art perfected by witches throughout the ages that is still not understood by scholars.</p>
            <p class="indent">Witches are worshippers of magic itself. The weave of magic is for them, the most precious gift the world has.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">THE WEAVE</h5>
                <p>The weave of magic is the source of all magic in the world. It is an unseen force that protects us from the chaos that is raw magic. It sifts magic to make it much less dangerous to use, but the weave can be damage by recklessly using magical abilities or by defying its laws. This damage can create areas of dead magic or even areas of wild magic.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent">Witches draw their magic directly into the weave. They act as an intermediary between raw magic and our world. Their magic is not arcane nor divine, it is both a the same time. They wield true magic.</p>
            <h4>DEFENDER OF BALANCE</h4>
            <p>Life is magic, but so is death. Witches worship magic in all of its forms. From the good to bad and the ugly. Magic is neither kind nor is it hateful. It is a neutral and natural force that should be used with caution. It is a delicate push and pull between the forces of the world. If that balance gives out, the world would be destroyed. After all, can good exist if there isn’t evil?</p>
            <p class="indent">Witches have for sacred mission to protect the weave. Each of them has their way of helping, but they all want to protect magic and the balance between good and evil. they have sworn to never let those primordial forces fall out of order, no matter the cost.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A WITCH</h4>
            <p>When making a witch, consider how your character came into have such a deep connection with the weave. Maybe you were raised by witches and were taught at a young age the ancestral tradition of witchcraft, or maybe you survived a traumatic incident was the weave got damaged. Perhaps a witch once saved your life and you want to be strong as she was, or maybe a goddess of magic gave you the power to sense the weave.</p>
            <p class="indent">When creating a witch, it is also important to know how do you want your character to defend the world. Is it by simply being kind, or is it by chasing down people who broke the laws of magic? Perhaps, you want to help the dead pass to the afterlife.</p>
            <p class="indent">Witches also usually have unique ways of channelling their magic. Do you craft poisons, potions and powerful elixirs, do you have a familiar that can help you fight, or do you perform ancient and intricate rituals to empower your abilities?</p>
            <p class="indent">Why are you now an adventurer? Do you want to parkour the lands to find people who tour help, or perhaps you’re looking for witches that have disappeared on a mission? The possibilities are endless.</p>

            <description>
                <p>You can shape and bend magic to your will due to your connection with the supernatural. See chapter 10 of the Player Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the witch spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your witch spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these witch spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Sleep and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Sleep using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells since the power of your magic relies on your attunement to magic. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>Since you you have such a deep connection with magic, you can use an arcane, divine or druidic focus, or any magical object as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.</p>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast a Witch spell that you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

                <p>Each witch identifies themselves as being part of a Coven. Covens are communities of witches often lead by a High Priest or a High Priestess that has for mission to protect the witches of their coven and to teach new witches how to use their powers. Each Coven has its ideals which shape the kind of magic they specialize in. Most witches see other members of their coven as family which explains why most witches are protective of their coven. Due to the difference in ideas of certain covens, it’s not rare for covens to be at war with one another even if their end goal is the same: keeping the balance of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 2nd level, you choose a witch coven which will shape your magical abilities. You can choose between the Coven of Black Magic, the Coven of White Magic, the Coven of Spiritual Magic or the Coven of Natural Magic. All of them are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd, 6th and 14th level.</p>
                <h5>COVEN SPELLS</h5>
                <p>Each Coven has a list of spells - its Coven Spells - that you gain at the Witch levels noted in the Coven description. Once you gain a Coven spell, you always know it, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you know.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you have a Coven spell that doesn’t appear on the Witch spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Witch spell for you.</p>

                <p>Casting a spell might be seen as trivial in a world like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but for witches, spellcasting is seen as an art in of itself. Whether it is trough potions, familiars or rituals, witches are taught how to express their magic via a medium of their choice. If the coven chosen by the witch answers of why they are casting spells, their witchcraft specialty answers the question of how they cast spells. Each specialty usually coexists inside the same coven, making covens recoupments of witches that express their power differently.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 3rd level, you choose a way to express your magical prowesses. You can choose between the Potion Specialty, the Familiar Specialty or the Ritual Specialty.

The nature-based abilities of this coven come from the friendship that witches of this coven have with druids.

            <p>You invoke the power of the moon to smite down your enemies. Choose a creature within 120ft. of you. that creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 8d6 radiant damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form for the next minute.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the moon is in sight when casting the spell, this spell deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
