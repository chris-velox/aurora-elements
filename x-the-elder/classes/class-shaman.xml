        <description>
            <p>A wild looking half-orc lumbers through the forest, his arcane tattoos glistening in the light that penetrates the forest canopy. A child from his tribe had reportedly seen a group of goblins cutting down ceremonial trees in their sacred grove. Slicing his hand the half-orc smeared his blood on a the hilt of his heartwood maul. His weapon now pulsed with a deep green energy as he ventured forth to deal with the fools that would dare profane their grove. They would pay for desecrating the resting place of his ancestors.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hunched over, elderly halfling grips his necklace as he faces down the leader of the hobgoblin war-band. The necklace, made from the finger bones of the previous shamans of his tribe, allows their spirits to take charge of his body. With their aid his life force is enhanced by theirs and he moves with the vigor of youth. Quick as lightning, he strikes at the hobgoblin’s head with his ancient club. As his foe slumps to the ground, he reflects on his time defending his people as their champion. Soon his time would end, and his body would die, but his spirit would join the previous shamans, aiding the next champion of their tribe.</p>
            <p class="indent">A hunched over elvish woman uses her primal connection to life-magic to conduct an ancient ritual on a stolen lock of hair. Far across town, the village fool comes down with a mysterious illness, and within hours he succumbs to the strange pox. The townsfolk suspect dark magic was at play, but after a few days they bury the fool and move on. The man who had dared to insult the old elf had paid for the transgression with his life.</p>
            <h4>CONDUITS OF NATURAL ENERGY</h4>
            <p>Shamans are the rare few that learn to open themselves to the natural energy that exists in all living things. Using their connection to this power, they are able to use primal energy to enhance their bodies, place curses on foes, or heal the sick. Shamanistic magic is ancient in its origins, and the teachings of shamans that are passed from one generation to the next trace their beginnings to the dawn of the world. Most Shamans embrace the old ways. They find civilized society uncomfortable, instead preferring to spend time in the wild.</p>
            <h4>OVERWHELMING POWER</h4>
            <p>Shamans don’t come to learn their magic by study, but through meditation and introspection they learn to channel the raw power innate in all living things. Their connection to the natural world is intense, and they have little control over the flow of energy once they open themselves up to the primal powers of creation. Many who seek become shamans are overwhelmed and consumed by the life-energies around them, turning into large trees or stone statues vaguely reminiscent of humanoids. But, for the few that survive the initiation rituals, they become conduits able to channel the primal energy of creation to perform powerful and overwhelming feats of magic.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SHAMAN</h4>
            <p>When creating your Shaman consider how you came to be a conduit for the power of nature. Were you chosen from birth to be the champion of your tribe, destined to bear the power that comes with the spiritual support of your ancestors? Did a terrible hag steal you away and raise you in her ways, teaching you the secrets of curses and hex magic? Or did you study under an ancient hermit, learning to manipulate the primal forces present in all things to heal the broken?</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever your origin, consider how your relationship to the natural world effects your character. Do you gently beseech the power of nature? Or do you violently wrest control of the primeval creative energies around you?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Shaman quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Wisdom your highest ability score followed by Constitution. Second choose the hermit background. Third select the shillelagh and vicious mockery cantrips along with the 1st-level spells entangle and heroism.</p>
            <h5>OPTIONAL RULE: MULTICLASSING</h5>
            <p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose the savant as one of your classes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Minimum.</em></strong> You must have at least a 13 in Wisdom to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a shaman.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Proficiencies Gained.</em></strong> If shaman isn’t your initial class, you gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, and one skill from the shaman skill list.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Primal Magic class feature from the shaman class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Primal Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast shaman spells you know.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>
                <p>Your connection to the powerful energy of creation allows you to channel primordial power to cast spells.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use a Shamanistic Focus as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells. See <i>Creating a Shamanistic Focus</i> for the rules to create or acquire a Shamanistic Focus.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the shaman spell list. You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have, and the level of these spell slots. All of your spell slots are of the same level. To cast one of your shaman spells of 1st-level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the shaman spell list, which is detailed below. The Spells Known column of the Shaman table shows when you learn more shaman spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new shaman spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the shaman spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your shaman spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a shaman spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast a shaman spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. The spell does not need to be one of your known shaman spells to be cast as a ritual.</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5>CREATING A SHAMANISTIC FOCUS</h5>
                    <p>Shamans channel the unbridled energy of creation to produce their spells, and if they are not careful, they can easily lose control and be overwhelmed. To avoid being consumed by their own magic, shamans channel their spells through a special object known as a Shamanistic Focus.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Each shaman crafts their own personal Shamanistic Focus as part of their training to control the power of nature. A Shamanistic Focus is often crafted out of an item of great personal significance; the bone of a tribal elder, a personalized gift from a loved one, or a piece of wood from their sacred grove. The personal significance of the Focus anchors the shaman to this world and prevents them from being consumed by the overwhelming power of nature.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Due to their personal nature, Shamanistic Foci cannot be purchased. However, if a shaman's Focus is destroyed, they can expend 5 gp and one hour to craft a new Shamanistic Focus.</p>

                <p>Starting at 2nd level, you learn to prepare special totems that allow you to tap into specific primeval powers without the risk of overwhelming your body and soul.</p>
                <p class="indent">You learn two totems of your choice from the list at the end of this class description. When you gain certain shaman levels, you can prepare additional totems, as shown in the totems column of the Shaman Table.

            <description>
                <p>Upon reaching 3rd level, you adopt a spirituality. Your spirituality dictates the way you interact with the primal forces of nature and the way you manifest your power. Most shamans learn their spirituality directly from their mentor, tribal elders, or a powerful creature of the natural world. However, some shamans have been known to develop their own spirituality in the absence of a mentor.</p>
                <p class="indent">Choose one of the following Spiritualities; Curse-Binder, Spirit-Warrior, or Witch-Doctor, each of which is detailed at the end of this class description.</p>
                <h5>SPIRITUALITY SPELLS</h5>
                <p>Each spirituality has a list of spells that you learn upon reaching certain shaman levels noted in the spirituality description. Once you learn a Spirituality Spell it does not count against your number of Spells Known. You cannot replace a Spirituality Spell with another shaman spell at the end of a long rest or when you gain a level in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent">Upon learning a Spirituality Spell, if it is not already, the spell becomes a shaman spell for you.</p>
