        <description>
            <p>A monster stalks the darkened city streets, leaving silence and death in its wake. Its gaze alights upon a figure wandering alone, their cloak pulled tight against the nightly chill, and it darts forward to feast. Only as its victim turns, silver blade flashing, does the vampire realize it’s not the only hunter out on the town tonight.</p>
            <p class="indent">The elven scholar doubles over as something primal claws up from inside her. Slender fingers swell into rending talons, delicate skin thickens into furred hide, and tapered ears flood with panicked noise. Her eyes snap open, shining with bestial light, and she screams a bloody battle cry.</p>
            <p class="indent">The blue-scaled warrior sniffs the damp dungeon air a moment, gesturing silently to his companions. There’s an ambush ahead. The goblins have only a moment to realize they’ve been spotted, and then his weapon ignites with crackling lightning and the darkness erupts with shrieks. Crude spears form a bristling wall, but the dragonborn warrior seems to vanish past them, moving with uncanny sleed as his blade lashes out.</p>
            <p class="indent">Every slayer is a hybrid, only partly mortal. Some inherited the power flowing through their veins, while others made a pact with an otherworldly power or were inducted into secretive orders through mutative rituals.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever the source of their unnatural power, the slayer wields it as a weapon. Often just as feared as the creatures they hunt, these half-monster warriors delve into ancient lore in an effort to understand and master their stranger natures.</p>
            <h4>THOSE WHO HUNT MONSTERS</h4>
            <p>The archetypal slayer is a swift combatant who can easily exploit the weak links in the enemy’s battle line. Escape soon becomes impossible, as their quarry is isolated and brought down. Then the slayer can pick apart the remaining scattered foes at their leisure.</p>
            <p class="indent">Attempts to pin the slayer down inevitably fail, for they move with unearthly speed, and every blow that fails to kill them simply opens the door to more of their otherworldly strength. A slayer left bloodied and broken is more dangerous than ever, and will soon be back in the fight.</p>
            <p class="indent">Blending close-range destructive magic with a strong sword-arm and quick feet, the lightly-armored slayer dodges and darts around opposition, inflicting grievous wounds on all who get too close.</p>
            <h4>OCCULT SECRETS</h4>
            <p>No slayer can survive long without exploring the supernatural power that lurks in their veins. These half-breed hunters seldom receive careful guidance, but must instead delve into forgotten tomes and old folk tales, learning their own nature through experimentation and study. Such insights offer great power to the scholarly slayer.</p>
            <p class="indent">Slayers who explore their magical nature can develop more dangerous skills, learning to truly draw forth their monstrous qualities as they transform into unnatural war forms, or devise magic rites fuelled by their own life force. Slayers are no stranger to sacrifice, especially if it means the defeat of a true foe.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SLAYER</h4>
            <p>When you create your slayer character, consider the origin of their power. Did you imbibe the blood of an ancient fiend, or were you sired by a fey noble? Did you seek out this power, or resent having it thrust upon you? How did your loved ones respond to these changes?</p>
            <p class="indent">What drives you to the hunt? Have you joined a formal order of monster hunters, or are you seeking answers as a lone wanderer? Do you want revenge on someone who cursed you, or have you simply embraced the thrill of power?</p>
            <p class="indent">What is your relationship with your otherworldly magic? Do you eagerly search for ancient lore to extend your powers, or is every fresh secret an unwelcome revelation?</p>
            <p class="indent">Why did you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find their camaraderie a much-needed comfort, or worry that your monstrous nature will bring them to harm?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a slayer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. A high Constitution score is ideal, and should replace Intelligence for slayers distinterested in casting spells. Second, choose the haunted one background (<em>Curse of Strahd</em>, pg. 209).</p>

                <p>Starting at 2nd level, you learn to channel your magical vitality into formal spells.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Slayer table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what level those slots are; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your slayer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell bane, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
                <h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
                <p>At 2nd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the slayer spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Slayer table shows when you learn more slayer spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new slayer spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the slayer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the slayer spell list, which must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your slayer spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a slayer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

            <p>It is the lot of the living to mourn the dead, and the doom of the dead to envy the living. When the two meet, the results are seldom kind. Necromantic rites may bind a ghost to a living soul, or spirit-twisting regrets might chain ancient ancestors or lost lovers to a mortal tether. Some even claim to have been sired by ghosts, half-dead from birth.</p>

            <p>The world of mortals is rife with dark spirits who feed on the violence of millenia, clinging to ancient grudges and growing strong on well-aged hatred. Some are lost ghosts who have shed memories of anything but bloodshed. Others are faded demons, fallen gods of war, or the souls of once-mighty blades left to rust in dungeons and armories.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever their origin, these vicious hexblades eagerly latch onto new hosts willing (or simply able) to offer them a fresh sword arm. Such is the Covenant of the Hexblade, a partnership forged in bloody steel.</p>

                <p>Starting when you join this covenant at 3rd level, you awaken a vengeful spirit that dwells within you, called a hexblade. When you complete a long rest, you can allow your hexblade to possess one weapon you are holding.</p>
                <p class="indent">The possessed weapon becomes indestructible and magical, if it was not already, and you can’t be disarmed of it unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon the weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport to your hand.</p>
                <p class="indent">While wielding the possessed weapon, you add thunder to the list of damage types you can inflict with your Cursed Brand, or with any slayer spells that inflict your choice of cold, fire, or lightning damage. In addition, when you hit a creature within 5 feet with the weapon, you can expend one spell slot to deal additional thunder damage to the target. The extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d6.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your hexblade can only possess a single weapon at a time, and it cannot possess a sentient weapon.</p>

            <p>Vampires are among the most feared ladies and lords of the undead. Immortal slaves to their own bloodthirst, vampires yearn to make slaves of the living in turn. Daywalking thralls or lovers often receive lesser strains of vampiric power, while the rare mortal children of a vampire’s union may inherit traces of undead might. Some vampire hunters go so far as to claim this power for themselves, brewing cocktails of tainted blood from their enemy’s veins.</p>
            <p class="indent">These half-vampire slayers make up the Covenant of the Sanguine, who wield the hungry, unseen powers of the night.</p>

                <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain a number of reagent points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), which you can spend to create potions. This requires 1 minute of brewing per point spent, at the end of which you create a magic potion that lasts 1 hour before expiring into a useless mess.</p>
                <p class="indent">This potion contains a spell, which you choose from those available at your level in the Hag Recipes table. If a spell (such as alter self) offers a choice of effects, you must choose one of these upon brewing the potion. A creature that drinks the potion comes under the spell’s effects for its full duration or one hour, whichever is shorter.</p>
                <p class="indent">Creating each potion costs the number of reagent points associated with that spell in the Hag Recipes table. You can increase a spell’s effective level by spending additional reagent points equal to the additional levels. If a spell consumes material components when cast, the brewing process requires components of equal value.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can never have more reagant points than your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended reagant points when you complete a long rest. You can also expend a Pact Magic spell slot to regain reagent points equal to the slot’s level.</p>
