            <p>You cause a tree to grasp at a creature within 10 feet of it with its branches, pulling and constricting that creature. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d8 bludgeoning damage, be pulled to the tree, and become restrained. At the start of each of its turns, the restrained creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice) against the spell’s saving throw DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained.</p>
