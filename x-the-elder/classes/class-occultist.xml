        <description>
            <p>Occultists study monsters, and the planes they hail from. They could be Archeologists, Monster Hunters, or even Cult Fanatics. There are currently 3 Fields of Study of the Occult: Demonology, Psionogy, and Mythology. Demonologists study the lower planes: from the chaotic denizens of the Abyss, to the rigid cast systems of the Nine hells. Psionocists study cosmic horrors, specializing in Aberrations and focusing their study on places like The Astral Plane or The Far Realm. Mythologists specialize in mythical creatures, with a focus on Fey and the elemental forces of nature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any who research the occult are warped by its study, adopting traits of the very creatures they seek to understand. Occultists learn to draw on magical power the same way monsters do: through innate affinity. Spells known by Occultists become a part of them, leaving them with no need for spell slots.</p>
            <div>
                <h5 class="caption">Mechanically Speaking</h5>
                <p>This class mimics a full caster, but lacks spell slots. As you gain levels in this class, you will gain spells you can cast a certain number of times per day. The spell progression mirrors that of an Eldritch Knight or an Arcane Trickster, but you will have far more castings of the limited spells you know. The theme here is monster features. You will gain access to a number of traits found exclusively on monster stat blocks, for example: an AOE that recharges on a d6 roll. This class also has interesting synergy with spellcasting racial traits. Try it out, and tell me what you think!</p>

                <p>When someone ventures into the realm of the occult, they are seeking lore on specific creatures and places.

            <p>Mythology focuses on the study of nature, and its connection to magic. It is not uncommon to meet mythologists who study Monstrosities, like Griffons or Manticores, but more often then not, their study revolves around the Feywild and the Inner Planes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Mythologists acclimate themselves to the magic of the natural world by exposing themselves to it. As such, they learn to not only resist its more harmful effects, but to commune, and become one with it.</p>
            <p class="indent">You take your spells from the Druid spell list, and your spellcasting ability modifier is Wisdom.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you gain your Font of Mana feature at 2nd level, select one damage type from Fire, Lightning, or Cold.</p>
