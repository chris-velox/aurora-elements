        <description>
            <p>A plate-clad warrior strides through the worst of the Blood War, laying about with a massive blade. Screaming demons recoil from explosive blows as his heavy armor shrugs off their claws. He lifts a struggling demon by the neck and drains its life into himself.</p>
            <p class="indent">A cowled figure slips silently through a well-guarded gate before disappearing in a puff of brimstone, an assassin’s stiletto already in motion. A moment later, her target lies unmoving at her feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">A handsome face prepares to address a mob, with an imp whispering invisible advice. His words drip honey and venom, turning the people against their rulers, starting an insurrection that topples a righteous king.</p>
            <h4>KNIGHTS OF THE NINE</h4>
            <p>The Blackguards draw power from covenants made to the Archdevils, the Lords of the Nine Hells.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Blackguard shares similarities to the Paladin, but rather than smite his enemies with divine power, he lays the Mark of his patron upon them, ripping pieces of the soul away when struck and healing the Blackguard.</p>
            <p class="indent">Noble in the eyes of Hell, the Blackguard are ambassadors, commanders, and assassins for the infernal host and its eternal struggle against the screaming incursions of the Abyss. Blackguards are found outside the Hells on critical assignments, executing the Archdevils’ will on both the Outer and Prime Material planes.</p>
            <h4>THE ORDER OF DESOLATION</h4>
            <p>Acceptance into the Order of Desolation draws an initiate into fraternity with every other Blackguard, regardless of which Archdevil they serve. Each Covenant selects its prospectives from the mass of devout worshipers, and a scant few survive the rigors of their training.</p>
            <p class="indent">Every Archdevil has devoted worshipers in churches, fanes, and cults, but the Blackguards consider themselves more alike than to the priests and warlocks of their master. A temple or cult may believe that the presence of an Blackguard is a sign that their patron smiles on their actions, but the Blackguards are proud of their independence. They serve no other authority, and a hellknight can be expected to put the needs of the Order before the commands of their own Covenant.</p>
            <h4>BANNERETS OF THE BLOOD WAR</h4>
            <p>Blackguards command respect from fiends. Low-ranking devils may defer to the fearsome reputation of the Order. On the other hand, demons and their allies recognize the threat posed by even a single Blackguard, and will put their full attention to destroying them on sight, preferring a Blackguard to other targets.</p>

                <p>There is a well of infernal power within you, represented by a number of dice given on the Blackguard table above, that replenishes at the end of a short or long rest. Using this pool, you can transfer hit points between you and another creature. As an action, you touch another creature to attempt to establish a conduit between you.</p>
                <p class="indent">If the creature is unwilling, it makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If it fails, the creature knows you have created a conduit between you. If it succeeds, it is immune to your use of this ability for twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p class="indent">After establishing a conduit, you can transfer hit points: either draining hit points from the subject and healing yourself by the same amount; or draining your hit points and healing the subject by the same amount. The conduit then closes.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you transfer hit points from yourself or have a willing subject, you choose how many, up to half the donor creature’s current hit points. Spend one die from your pool, no matter how many hit points are transferred.</p>
                <p class="indent">Against an unwilling subject, roll a number of d6s from your conduit pool and transfer hit points equal to the result or the current hit points of the target, whichever is lower.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you are fully healed, you can use this power to gain temporary hit points. You cannot give another creature temporary hit points, but when granting hit points, your temporary hit points are lost first.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you establish a conduit, you can instead transfer one level of exhaustion to or from an creature, by spending one die from your pool. When you use this ability in this way, you do not transfer any hit points.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Upon reaching 2nd level, you learn how to use the power granted by your Archdevil to stain the souls of other creatures. As a bonus action, you expend a spell slot to place a Mark of your patron Archdevil on one or more creatures within 30 feet. Only one Mark can affect a creature at once.</p>
                <p class="indent">The number of Marks you can place with each spell slot is given on the Mark table below. When you create Marks, you can use excess Marks to refresh an equal number of expended dice from your Fiendish Conduit pool; else, excess Marks are lost.</p>
                <p class="indent">When a Marked creature you can see takes damage, you can consume the Mark without using an action, inflicting 2d4 necrotic damage as the Mark tears at the soul. If you are within 30 feet of the creature, you regain one hit point for each die of damage your Mark inflicts.

                <p>By 2nd level, you have earned your patron Archdevil’s favor, granting you magic to cast spells.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>The Blackguard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. When you wish to cast a spell you expend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of Blackguard spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the Blackguard spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Blackguard spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your Blackguard level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">Preparing a new list of Blackguard spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Blackguard spells, since your power derives from your ability to command the attention of your patron. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an Blackguard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                </center>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Spellcasting Focus:</strong> You can use an (un)holy symbol (found in chapter 5 of the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>) as a spellcasting focus for your Blackguard spells.</p>

The creature loses its action on that turn if no creature is within range of its attacks. Else, if you make no choice, the creature can act normally.</p>
                <p class="indent">On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the creature, or the spell ends. The creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, the spell ends.</p>

                <p>You manifest a mote of Hell on the Material world. A 15-foot radius sphere of darkness, brimstone, and blasting heat appears, centered on a point within range and lasting for the duration of the spell. The cloud of hellfire echoes with the cries of damned souls that can be heard by anyone within 30 feet of the cloud. No light, even magical light, can illuminate the area and any creatures fully within the area are blinded. The cloud warps the timescape and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 fire damage. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 2d6 force damage from the buffeting winds.</p>
