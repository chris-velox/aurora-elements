    <description>
      <p class="flavor">A tattooed elf, veiled and cloaked, draws his obsidian dagger across the sand, calling forth from the lines a ghostly apparition to help him and his allies find their way. A trio of halfling hermits gather among candles and incense, chanting words of power to bait spirits from the shadows. The bejeweled human, dressed in exotic garb and golden chains bellows a spell which echoes with the voices of an army of lost souls, a fiendish glint in his eyes as blood drips from his palm.</p>
      <p class="indent">Unlike shamans who pray to the spirits of nature, witches bind the transient souls of intelligent beings lost betwixt the realm of the living and the beyond. As a witch, you learn to summon these souls and bind them to your will, gaining protection from them as well as the power to debilitate your enemies. As you attain higher levels, the covenant you choose to live by grants you further abilities which extend the utility and power of these bonds in different ways.</p>
      <h4>THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT</h4>
      <p>Witches may or may not have a level of respect for the spirits they bind, though one could say they should. Some witches tap into the residual energies of long-departed souls, while others use extant spiritual beings as conduits for their spellcasting. Either way and whether or not they wish, witches bind part of their own soul to those that surround them.</p>
      <p class="indent">Witch spells mostly deal with manipulation of spiritual energies (both living and dead) and protections against the beings which supply those energies. As part of their connection to the spiritual world, they are also privy to information and secrets normally not meant for mortal minds. As such, witches are often powerful enchanters, abjurers, and diviners.</p>
      <h4>BONDS OF THE SOUL</h4>
      <p>Witches acknowledge that there is a spiritual connection between all things -- forces that inexplicably and randomly bind beings and happenings together in a shared fate or destiny. They see other witches as brothers and sisters, and other classes as close cousins. As a consequence, witches are often fond of forming alliances. One kind of alliance is the circle that a witch belongs to.</p>
      <p class="indent">The covenant that a witch joins is the manifestation of a philosophy regarding the nature of spirits. Some, like the covenant of unity, believe in a supreme energy that extends beyond the physical world, weaving together magic and the collective conscience of all living things. Others, from the covenant of blood for example, believe in a more intimate connection between the physical world and the other side. In this philosophy, each soul is tied to something close to it in the physical world -- a body, an object, or location that was important to it when it was alive.</p>
      <h4>CREATING A WITCH</h4>
      <p>When deciding on the witch class, think about what led your character to tap into the spirit world. Maybe witchcraft is a tradition in the area, or your character comes from an area rife with a ghostly past. Superstition is also a good trigger for a fascination with spirits. What is your relationship with spirits? Is there a measure of mutual respect? Perhaps your character feels more like a servant to the spirit than the other way around, or maybe they possess the entitlement to dominate and extort spiritual beings.</p>
      <p class="indent">How did your character come to be an adventurer? It could be that he or she was a pariah in their community due to contact with the other side, cast out and forced to fend for him or herself. Perhaps your character is even haunted by a particular spirit and seeks away to control or be rid of it.</p>
      <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
      <p>You can make a witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, select the Hermit background.

    <description>
      <p>Your contact with the spirit world and intuitive knowledge of the magic sustains it grants you the use of spells.</p>
      <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
      <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p>
      <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
      <p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these witch spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>cure wounds</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>cure wounds</i> using either slot.</p>
      <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
      <p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list.</p>
      <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
      <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
      <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
      <p class="indent">Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
      <p class="indent">Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
      <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
      <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.</p>

      <p>At 1st level, you gain the ability to enter a trance known as the witch’s quickening. Entering the trance is a bonus action and allows you to see into the Ethereal Plane up to 60 feet for up to one minute. You also gain insight into the emotional energy surrounding you, letting you know if and what spiritual creatures are within 60 feet, as well as granting you advantage to Wisdom (Insight) checks for the duration. Finally, while in your quickening, if you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage you can substitute that damage with psychic damage instead. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

    <requirements />
    <description>
      <p>At 2nd level you can bind spirits to your service. Binding a spirit is much like casting a ritual spell and takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted activity. During this time, the witch speaks the invocations required to summon the spirit forth and enacts the rite of binding depending on which philosophy the witch belongs to. A blood witch might utilize a bone fragment to bind the spirit, while a shadow witch might bargain with the summoned spirit, exchanging a secret for the spirit’s service.</p>
      <p>When you choose a spirit to bind from the list at the end of this class description, you fill one of your available spell slots with the spirit. The spell slot used is no longer available for casting spells, and it remains unavailable for as long as the spirit filling it remains bound to you. The spirit is said to be of a level equal to the spell slot filled to bind it. Thus, a Spirit of Passion occupying a 6th level spell slot is a level 6 spirit. You cannot have more than one spirit with the same name bound at one time. You can have a number of spirits bound equal to the number in the class table.</p>
      <p>Depending on the type of spirit, you gain certain benefits while the spirit remains bound and an additional effect when you release the spirit, as detailed in the Binding Rites section.</p>
      <p>Releasing a spirit is a bonus action, although some spirits allow release as a reaction. Once a spirit has been released, it no longer provides its passive effect and the spell slot it occupied is considered expended.</p>
      <p>A witch may exchange any spirit they have bound by performing the ritual as described above.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Witches of the Covenant of Blood believe in strong connections between the physical world and the spiritual one. Spirits are connected to the physical world through objects that were important to them while they were alive. This knowledge allows a witch to bind spirits to their power more easily –– as long as they know a bit about the spirit’s life.</p>
      <p class="indent">Though not always, witches from the covenant of blood tend to dominate the spirits under their control. They generally take care to leave spirits intact and in a state no worse than before they were bound, but nevertheless are capable of using a spirit’s weaknesses against them, taking advantage of their connections to the physical world in order to gain power over them.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Witches of the Covenant of Charm tap deep into the emotions which govern lingering spirits’ behaviours. They use these emotions as signposts and guides to manipulate the desires and shape the aspirations of the living. They believe that although lingering spirits are echoes of the past, they hold the key to individual futures. By harnessing the raw emotional energy of the beyond, one can gain absolute control over the hearts and minds of those around them.</p>
      <p class="indent">Witches of this philosophy vary in their treatment of spirits. Some befriend and learn from the spirits they bind, using that knowledge to further their own ends. Others take only cursory notice of the spirits they enslave -- an attitude that often carries over into their living interactions, manipulating and charming those they will, without any true regard for the desires of those they meet.</p>

      <p>At 6th level you may tie one of your spirits you already have bound to a small object as an action. The spirit still counts towards your maximum bonds while attached to the object. When you create a token, you also choose a recipient to whom the token bears significance. As long as the recipient is in possession of the token, the spirit provides its passive effect as though the spirit were bound by the recipient (even if the holder of the token is not a witch). In either case, the magic holding the spirit to the object expires after 24 hours when it returns to your control. If the token is returned to you, you can break this magic sooner as a bonus action, regaining use of the spirit.</p>

    <description>
      <p>The Covenant of Ruin has less respect for spirits than the other covenants. Witches who bind these spirits utilize their magic to torture and pressure spirits in order to extract power from them. Their philosophy revolves around invoking ruin and causing as much damage as possible.</p>
      <p class="indent">Though good witches of this covenant are rare, they are not unknown. Good witches who share this covenant’s ideology typically aim to bind evil spirits, turning these beings into weapons for good against their will (though this can hardly be considered to be completely benign). These witches often claim this is for the greater good –– using evil to combat evil.</p>

      <p>The Covenant of Unity subscribes to a philosophy that all spiritual entities are connected by a collective consciousness.

      <p>In the presence of a spirit of Agony, foes’ wounds continue to bleed and fires continue to burn. While Agony is bound, for every damage die you roll that shows a 1, you may treat the roll as the maximum possible number for that die for a number of dice up to the level of the spirit.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Release.</em></strong> You may release Agony as part of any attack or spell which deals damage. In addition to the damage, you may roll an extra number of equivalent dice equal to the level of the spirit. If the attack or spell uses more than one type of die, choose the largest. This extra damage is psychic damage. Additionally, all 1s are treated as the maximum value for each die.</p>

      <p>Spirits of Desire impress your will onto others and enhance existing desires. Friendly and charmed creatures within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws against your spells. Once an affected creature succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw against one of your spells, that creature is immune to this spirit’s passive effect for 24 hours.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Release.</em></strong> When you release this spirit as a bonus action, a number of creatures within 30 feet up to the spirit level become charmed if they fail a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. This effect lasts one minute. The effect ends prematurely if you or your allies damage the creature. The spirit’s level also determines what kind of creatures can be charmed. At 3rd level and below, only humanoids and animals can be affected. At 4th level and above, all creatures can be affected.</p>

      <p>Spirits of Envy take from others what they covet for themselves – life. Whenever you deal damage to a hostile creature while Envy is bound, you regain the spirit’s level in hit points. You may only gain hit points this way once per turn.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Release.</em></strong> You may release Envy as a bonus action to grant yourself or an ally within 30 feet temporary hit points equal to 3 times the spirit level.

      <p>Spirits of Fear bring nightmares to life. While Fear is bound, you gain proficiency in Charisma (Intimidation) checks, or add twice your proficiency bonus if you already are proficient. In addition, attacks made against you are at disadvantage. Once a foe has rolled against you with disadvantage and hits, it can no longer be affective by this passive ability for 24 hours.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Release.</em></strong> When Fear is released from its bonds as a bonus action, a number of creatures equal to the spirit level within 30 feet make a Wisdom save or be frightened of you for 1 minute. An affected creature must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful save, the fear effect ends.</p>

      <p>While emboldened by a spirit of trust, you can help your allies through cooperative spellcasting, or protect them from harmful spellcasting effects from other allies. While Trust is bound, you can use your reaction to aid an ally within 30 feet to cast a spell, giving them advantage on an attack roll or ability check made with that spell. Alternatively, if that spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is increased by 1. Finally, you can also use your reaction to render a single ally within 30 feet immune to the harmful effects of any ally’s spells until your next turn.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Release.</em></strong> When trust is released as part of your Help action, you impart a bonus to the spell save DC of a single ally within 30 feet for the next spell they cast before your next turn. This bonus is equal to the level of this spirit. If the spell forces more than one creature to make a saving throw, only one creature is affected by the increased DC.</p>
