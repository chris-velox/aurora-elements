        <description>
            <p>A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with every sort of tool, carefully screwing a gear into place amidst a complex maze of clockwork. The device begins to tick and she and watches with a smile of pride as the automaton straightens and stands.</p>
            <p class="indent">A troll growls in hunger as it looms over a dwarf, who slides a long, brass tube from across his back. With a thundering boom, a gout of fire and shrapnel erupts from the tube, and the troll’s growls turn into shrieks of panic as it turns to flee.</p>
            <p class="indent">With a thunderous crash a figure lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a towering presence stands amidst the war-torn scene, clad in mechanical plate mail with smoke billowing from a chimney on the back. The glowing visor swivels to inspect the wreckage. It raises a gauntlet, and lightning crackles forth.</p>
            <p class="indent">Makers of mechanical objects and devices, engineers are defined by their inventive nature. Where a wizard studies magic, they turn to science to unlcok the mysteries of the universe thorough study and investigation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Every engineer is defined by a specific craft. Engineers see mastering the basic methods of a craft as the first step to true progress, the invention of new methods and approaches. Engineers are students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, steam-powered armour, and mechanical beings that they can augment with additional mechanisms.</p>
            <p class="indent">All engineers are united by their curious and inventive nature. To an engineer, science is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year. Engineers value novelty and discovery. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>
                <p>Your scientific research has lead you to develop a number of inventions.</p>
                <h5>GADGETS</h5>
                <p>Your most reliable creations are your gadgets, which have been refined to the point of requiring only minimal maintenance.</p>
                <p class="indent">A gadget is an invention that can be used at will, without limited uses or requiring maintenance. Repeated tinkering and refinement has produced a reliable device, which is unlikely to fail or run out of fuel.</p>
                <p class="indent">You possess two gadgets of your choice from the engineer gadget list. You create additional engineer gadgets of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Gadgets column of the Engineer table.</p>
                <h5>INVENTIONS</h5>
                <p>The Engineer table shows how many inventions you have created of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those inventions is; all of your inventions are the same level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Inventions column of the Engineer table shows when you create more engineer inventions of your choice of 1st level and higher. An invention you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Invention Level column for your level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the engineer inventions you know and replace it with another invention from the engineer invention list, which also must be of a level for which you have inventions.</p>
                <h5>INVENTION USES</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, each of your inventions has a number of uses equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your Engineer level (minimum of one use). These uses last until consumed, and do not expire at the end of each day. Once an invention’s uses have been consumed it must undergo maintenance, although maintenance may be performed at any time to reset the invention to its maximum number of available uses. If an invention is used while active, the first effect ends when the second begins.</p>
                <p class="indent">Performing maintenance on an invention requires tinker’s tools and takes an hour of concentrated work. It also requires materials for replacement parts or consumed ingredients, such as black powder. Sufficient materials for the maintenance cycle of one invention can be found in an urban environment (or any other environment deemed appropriate by your dungeon master) after one hour of scavenging. Alternatively, they can be purchased in advance for 50 gp per invention level.</p>
                <h5>INVENTION ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is the ability associated with your engineer inventions, so you use your Intelligence whenever an invention refers to your invention ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an engineer invention you use and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Invention save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Invention attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                </center>
            </description>
            <sheet>
                <description>Your Invention Save DC is {{invention:save-dc}} and Invention attack modifier is {{invention:attack-mod}}. You can use a gadget an unlimited number of times with minimal maintenance. You can use each invention {{invention:uses}} times before needing to perform maintenance on it, which requires tinker’s tools and an hour of concentrated work. Your gadgets and inventions are shown in the spells section of the character sheet.</description>

                <p class="indent">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Potent Aptitude die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Potent Aptitude die is rolled, it is lost.</p>
                <p class="indent">A creature can have only one Potent Aptitude die at a time.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your Potent Aptitude die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 13th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 3rd level, you learn to employ all the knowledge you’ve accumulated to create and customize your own personalised automaton companion. Over the course of 8 hours, which can be done during a long rest, you can expend 50 gp worth of materials to finally finish your automaton, which has the following features:</p>
                <div class="reference">
                    <div element="ID_STORMCHASER_SCEC_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_ENGINEER_AUTOMATON_AUTOMATON_COMPANION_STATS" />
                </div>
                <p class="indent">Your automaton has an Intelligence score of 3 and a Charisma score of 1. Assign your automaton’s remaining ability scores as you see fit, using the following scores: 15, 14, 13, 12</p>
                <p class="indent">An automaton cannot benefit from magical healing or rests, and is instead restored to full hit points after it undergoes maintenance. If your automaton is irreparably destroyed, or you want to construct a different automaton, it costs 50 gp per automaton level and one full day of work. You may only have one automaton companion at a time and it takes 1 hour to change the target of this feature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, you can upgrade your automaton. Your automaton companion has 1 upgrade slot, and it gains more at higher levels, as shown in the Upgrades column of the engineer class table. Over the course of a long rest, you can replace or remove a number of upgrades up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one).</p>
                <p class="indent">Your automaton gains a variety of benefits while it is your companion:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The automaton obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your automaton acts on its own.</li>
                    <li>Your automaton’s level equals your engineer level, and for each engineer level you gain after 3rd, your automaton companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Your automaton has the proficiency bonus of a player character of the same level.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your automaton’s abilities also improve. Your automaton can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. Your automaton cannot increase its Intelligence or Charisma, and, as normal, it cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature, unless its description specifies otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Your automaton cannot wear armour, but you can integrate armour into its chassis. Over the course of a long rest, you can expend materials equal to half the cost of the armour in order to integrate it into your automaton. Your automaton must be proficient in armour in order to have it integrated.</li>
