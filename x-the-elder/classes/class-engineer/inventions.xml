            <p>As part of the action used to activate this invention, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within your weapon’s reach, otherwise the invention fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and it becomes sheathed in a thick acidic slime until the start of your next turn. Until the start of your next turn, if the target succeeds in grappling or maintaining a grapple, the slime is pressed into its body, causing it to immediately take 1d8 acid damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">This invention’s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 acid damage to the target, and the damage the target takes for taking grappling or maintaining a grapple increases to 2d8. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level and 17th level.</p>

            <p>As part of the action used to activate this invention, you must make a ranged attack with a weapon against one creature within your weapon’s range, otherwise the invention fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and it ignites in flame. At the start of your next turn, the creature takes fire damage equal to your invention ability modifier. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames, the effect ends.</p>

            <p>As part of the action used to activate this invention, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within your weapon’s reach, otherwise the invention fails. On a hit, the target suffers the attack’s normal effects, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn, as the cold energy seeps into its being. Additionally, if the target doesn’t move at least 5 feet before the start of your next turn, it immediately takes 1d8 cold damage, and the effect ends.</p>

            <p>You expel a burst of power. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use an invention of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each invention level above 1st.</p>

            <p>As you activate this invention, you use a rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish, the circle becomes a trap. This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your invention save DC to be discerned. The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the invention’s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the effect ends. A restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your invention save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends. After the trap is triggered, the invention ends when no creature is restrained by it.</p>

            <p>You expel a mass of thick, adhesive mesh at a point of your choice within range. The mesh fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The mesh is difficult terrain and lightly obscures their area. If the mesh isn’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the mesh collapses on itself, and the invention ends at the start of your next turn. Mesh layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. Each creature that starts its turn in the mesh or that enters it during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the mesh or until it breaks free. A creature restrained by the mesh can use its action to make a Strength check against your invention save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained. The mesh is flammable. Any 5-foot cube of mesh exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</p>

        <supports>SCEC Invention</supports>
        <description>
            <p>When you use this invention, you create a trap that will later trigger in response to a certain condition. You must attach it either to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed or turned on (such as a book, door, or computer terminal) to conceal the trap. The trap can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. At the GM’s discretion, certain actions may cause the trap to break or be rendered inoperative. The trap is well disguised, and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your invention save DC to be found. You decide what triggers the trap when you use the invention, such as entering a certain area or taking an object. You can further refine the trigger so the trap activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature kind. You can also set conditions that don’t trigger the trap.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you create the trap, choose a trap type:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Explosive Trap.</strong> When triggered, the trap erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the trap. The explosion spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the trap), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Invention Trap.</strong> You can store a prepared invention of 3rd level or lower in the trap by using it as part of creating the trap. The trap must target a single creature or an area. The invention being stored has no immediate effect when used in this way. When the trap is triggered, the stored invention is used. If the trap has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the trap. If the invention affects an area, the area is centered on that creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use an invention of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive trap increases by 1d8 for each invention level above 3rd. If you create an invention trap, you can store any invention of up to the same level as the trap level.</p>

            <p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool. Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the invention is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials. Creatures or magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this invention. You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the appropriate type of artisan’s tools.</p>

A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or weapon.</p>

            <p>You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the bolts. A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

            <p>A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your invention save DC to break free.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can refrain from firing the globe after activating the invention, if you wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of the invention. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.</p>

            <p>A blast of corrosive energy emits from you. Choose a target within range. A creature targeted by this invention must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 acid damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A creature destroyed in this way can not be revitalized. This power automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller object. If the target is a Huge or larger object, this invention disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it.</p>

            <p>You create defences that protect up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The secured area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can protect several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are using the invention. When you use this invention, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p>
            <p class="indent">Construct defences creates the following effects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Corridors.</strong> Fog fills all the secured corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Doors.</strong> All doors in the secured area are locked, as if sealed by the lock power. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an image to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Stairs.</strong> Mesh traps fill all stairs in the secured area from top to bottom, as the mesh trap invention. This mesh regenerates in 10 minutes if it is burned or torn away while the defences last.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Other.</strong> Debilitating gas is placed in two locations. The vapours return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while the defences last.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can create a permanently guarded and secured structure by using this invention there every day for one year.</p>

On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.</p>

            <p>You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.</p>
            <p class="indent">The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s concentration is broken.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use this invention and at the end of each turn while it is action, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">This invention can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the area, as determined by the GM.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Fissures.</strong> Fissures open throughout the invention’s area at the start of your next turn after you use the invention. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the invention’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge as it opens.</p>
            <p class="indent">A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below).</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Structures.</strong> The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you use the invention and at the start of each of your turns until the effect ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.</p>

            <p>You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You must be outdoors to use this invention. Moving to a place where you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the effect early. When you use the invention, you change the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the conditions again. When the effect ends, the weather gradually returns to normal. When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you can change its direction.</p>

            <p>Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is affected only once. The invention damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.</p>

            <p>A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each round while this invention is active, the storm produces different effects on your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 2.</strong> Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 3.</strong> You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 4.</strong> Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Round 5–10.</strong> Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.</p>
