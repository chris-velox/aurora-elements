        <description>
            <p class="flavor">A warrior who uses martial prowess and nature magic to combat threats on the edges of civilization.</p>
            <p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
            <p class="indent">After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
            <p class="indent">Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
            <p class="indent">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
            <h4>DEADLY HUNTERS</h4>
            <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
            <h4>INDEPENDENT ADVENTURERS</h4>
            <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p>
            <p class="indent">This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A RANGER</h4>
            <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
            <p class="indent">What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>
                <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>INTERCEPTION</h5>
                <p>When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
                <h5>MARINER</h5>
                <p>As long as you are not wearing heavy armor or using a shield, you have a swimming speed and a climbing speed equal to your normal speed, and you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <h5>SWITCH FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>While you are wielding a versatile weapon and no other weapons, you can add your Dexterity modifier (maximum of +1 while one-handed, maximum of +2 while two-handed) to your attack and damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>THROWING</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with thrown weapons, and each time you attack with such a weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately draw another weapon after the attack.</p>
                <h5>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.</p>

                <p class="indent">The target is marked as long as it’s on the same plane of existence as you and isn’t protected from divination magic. The mark also vanishes if you finish a long rest, are rendered unconscious, or use this feature again to target another creature.</p>

                <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. You also regain one expended use when you finish a short rest and don’t have an active mark.</p>

            <description>
                <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p class="indent">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells. To cast one of your ranger spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell animal friendship, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of ranger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC = 8</strong> + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p class="indent">You can cast a ranger spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Across the wilds, rangers follow various different archetypes whose members share a similar outlook on the world and their place and role within it.</p>
                <p class="indent">Also at 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger archetype, all detailed at the end of the class description. Many rangers of the same archetype form so called Conclaves, loose organizations aimed to focus, guide, and further the knowledge and training of their shared philosophy.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>
                <h5>ARCHETYPE SPELLS</h5>
                <p>Each archetype has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the archetype description. Once you gain access to an archetype spell, you always have it prepared. Archetype spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you gain an archetype spell that doesn’t appear on the ranger spell list, the spell is nonetheless a ranger spell for you.</p>

				<p>Also at 3rd level, you learn to call forth a spirit from the Feywild to be your loyal partner. You can spend 1 uninterrupted hour communing with the spirits of the Feywild and call forth a willing spirit to be your loyal companion. You determine its companion type, its size, speeds, and attacks (see Spirit Companion Types below). The spirit companion takes the form of a beast of your choice best fitting its chosen type.</p>
				<p class="indent">You can use an action to dismiss your spirit companion back into the Feywild — leaving behind anything it was carrying — or summon it back onto an empty space that you can see within 30 feet of you.</p>
				<p class="indent">If your spirit companion dies, its body vanishes after 1 minute, leaving behind anything it was carrying. You must spend 1 uninterrupted hour to return your spirit companion to life, at which point, you can also make any changes to its companion type, size, speed, and attacks as if summoning it for the first time.</p>
				<p class="indent">Your spirit companion uses the following rules:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your spirit companion counts as your animal companion and is considered trained for war. You can’t have other animal companions besides your spirit companion. (See Animal Companions at the end of this document.)</li>
					<li>Your spirit companion uses your proficiency bonus.</li>
					<li>Your spirit companion possesses your saving throw proficiencies and the skill proficiencies listed under its Spirit Companion Type (using your proficiency bonus).</li>
					<li>Your spirit companion adds your proficiency bonus to its damage rolls and they count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to non-magical attacks and damage.</li>
					<li>You can treat your spirit companion as a beast (instead of fey) in order to affect it with your spells and abilities.</li>
					<li>Your spirit companion shares all benefits of the following ranger features once you gain them: Natural Explorer, Hunter’s Eye, Ranger’s Stride, Superior Senses, and Ambuscade.</li>
					<li>For each ranger level you gain after 3rd, your spirit companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points by 5 + its Constitution modifier.</li>
					<li>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement ranger class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. You can also choose for it to take a feat instead of increasing its ability scores if your DM approves.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5 class="caption">PARTNER FEATURES</h5>
				<p>You and your spirit companion learn ways to effectively fight as one. The abilities you gain at higher levels refer to you and your companion as partners, and can be used if something affects or is done by the other partner. Both you and your spirit companion can use the following features, once you gain them.</p>
				<h5 class="caption">SPIRIT COMPANION TYPES</h5>
				<p>There are three distinct types of spirit companions. Each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you learn tactics to bring down your prey. Choose one benefit from the following list. When you finish a long rest, you can choose to replace your current benefit with another one from the list.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Avoid the Basilisk’s Gaze.</strong> When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Between Hammer and Anvil.</strong> Creatures don’t gain advantage on attack rolls against you from special features such as <em>Pack Tactics</em>, or when using the Help action or the optional flanking rule.</p>

The DC equals 10 or half the damage you would have dealt, whichever number is higher. (see <em>Xanathar’s Guide to Everything</em> p. 77)</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Close the Gap.</strong> You can use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards a hostile creature you can see. This movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Into the Belly of the Beast.</strong> While you are swallowed or engulfed by a creature, you have resistance to the damage it deals to you. In addition, your attacks against it have advantage and deal double damage.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>The Bigger They Come.</strong> When you try to shove a Large or larger creature, you can add your Focus Die to the Strength (Athletics) check and you may try to shove a creature even if it is more than one size larger than you.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Walking the Spider’s Web.</strong> You are considered invisible towards Blindsight and Tremorsense. A creature can only use normal sight to detect you.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong>Resist the Flayer’s Mind.</strong> When a creature you can see uses an ability that forces you to make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can add your Focus Die to the roll.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Wade in the Water.</strong> Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If your attack hits, you have advantage on the save, in addition to the attack’s normal effects.</p>

                <p class="indent"><strong>Turning the Tide.</strong> When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

            <p>As you cast this spell, you draw a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the circle disappears and becomes a magic trap.</p>
            <p class="indent">This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.</p>
            <p class="indent">The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell’s radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is restrained there until the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">A restrained creature can make a Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the restrained effect ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you cast this spell using 1 action, its duration is limited to 1 hour. If you cast this spell over 1 minute, its duration is 24 hours. After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is restrained by it.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Not all rangers are connected to nature and the wilderness. There are those that are stalking the dark alleys and dusty catacombs of the sprawling cities and metropolises of their world.</p>
            <p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
            <p class="indent">After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
            <p class="indent">Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
            <p class="indent">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
            <h4>DEADLY HUNTERS</h4>
            <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
            <h4>INDEPENDENT ADVENTURERS</h4>
            <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p>
            <p class="indent">This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A RANGER</h4>
            <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
            <p class="indent">What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

                <p class="indent">Pathfinder.<span class="feature"></span> Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your travel, and you have advantage on ability checks to identify structural hazards (such as loose shingles or collapsing floors and ceilings).</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>BLIND FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Being unable to see a creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it, provided the creature isn’t hidden from you.</p>
                <h5>CLOSE QUARTERS SHOOTER</h5>
                <p>You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.</p>
                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>
                <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <h5>DUAL WIELDING</h5>
                <p>You can engage in two-weapon fighting even if the melee weapons you’re wielding aren’t light, and you can draw or stow one additional melee weapon on each of your turns. Additionally, while you are wielding two one-handed melee weapons in different hands, the damage die of both weapons becomes a d8 for you.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>INTERCEPTION</h5>
                <p>When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
                <h5>PUGILISM</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes use a d4 for damage, and when you take the Attack action and attack only with unarmed strikes, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.</p>
                <h5>SWITCH FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>While you are wielding a versatile weapon and no other weapons, you can add your Dexterity modifier (maximum of +1 while one-handed, maximum of +2 while two-handed) to your attack and damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>THROWING</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with thrown weapons, and each time you attack with such a weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately draw another weapon after the attack.</p>
                <h5>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                <h5>TUNNEL FIGHTER</h5>
                <p>You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.</p>
                <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
                <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.</p>

        <description>
            <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
            <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
            <p class="indent">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells. To cast one of your ranger spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell animal friendship, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of ranger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>Spell save DC = 8</b> + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>Spell attack modifier =</b> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
            <p class="indent">You can cast a ranger spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
