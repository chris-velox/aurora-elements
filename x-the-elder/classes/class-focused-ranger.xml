        <description>
            <p class="flavor">A warrior who uses martial prowess and nature magic to combat threats on the edges of civilization.</p>
            <p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
            <p class="indent">After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
            <p class="indent">Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
            <p class="indent">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
            <h4>DEADLY HUNTERS</h4>
            <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
            <h4>INDEPENDENT ADVENTURERS</h4>
            <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p>
            <p class="indent">This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A RANGER</h4>
            <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
            <p class="indent">What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

            <description>
                <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p class="indent">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells. To cast one of your ranger spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell animal friendship, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of ranger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC = 8</strong> + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier =</strong> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p class="indent">You can cast a ranger spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

Most folk fear such places, but a Night Shade thrives in the darkness, seeking to instill fear into the hearts of their enemies. Such rangers are often found where evil lurks in the shadows, but also as part of military special forces.</p>

            <p>You can form a close bond with animals that are friendly to you or charmed by you.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast the spell, choose a friendly beast within range. The beast must have an Intelligence of 6 or lower, and remain in range during the entire casting. Its challenge rating may be no higher than 1/2 or the limit given by your proficiency with the Animal Handling skill, whichever is lower. See Animal Companions below for further information.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once bond, this beast becomes your loyal companion and will obey your commands to the best of its abilities, giving you advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks to command it.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, you establish a telepathic link with the beast. While within line of sight, the beast can understand your telepathic messages, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own, focusing on finding and protecting you and itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can’t have more beasts bond to you than animal companions you can control. If you cast this spell while you already have the maximum number of beasts bond, you must release a beast from its bonds in order to bond with a new one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can bond beasts with a higher challenge rating: CR 1 (2nd level), CR 2 (3rd level), CR 3 (4th level), CR 4 (5th level), CR 5 (6th level). The restriction to your character level still applies.</p>

            <p>You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of beasts. Each beast in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a beast can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed.

        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Not all rangers are connected to nature and the wilderness. There are those that are stalking the dark alleys and dusty catacombs of the sprawling cities and metropolises of their world.</p>
            <p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
            <p class="indent">After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
            <p class="indent">Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
            <p class="indent">Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
            <h4>DEADLY HUNTERS</h4>
            <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
            <h4>INDEPENDENT ADVENTURERS</h4>
            <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.</p>
            <p class="indent">This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A RANGER</h4>
            <p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain— perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
            <p class="indent">What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>BLIND FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Being unable to see a creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it, provided the creature isn’t hidden from you.</p>
                <h5>CLOSE QUARTERS SHOOTER</h5>
                <p>You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.</p>
                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>
                <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <h5>DUAL WIELDING</h5>
                <p>You can engage in two-weapon fighting even if the melee weapons you’re wielding aren’t light, and you can draw or stow one additional melee weapon on each of your turns. Additionally, while you are wielding two one-handed melee weapons in different hands, the damage die of both weapons becomes a d8 for you.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>INTERCEPTION</h5>
                <p>When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
                <h5>PUGILISM</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes use a d4 for damage, and when you take the Attack action and attack only with unarmed strikes, you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.</p>
                <h5>SWITCH FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>While you are wielding a versatile weapon and no other weapons, you can add your Dexterity modifier (maximum of +1 while one-handed, maximum of +2 while two-handed) to your attack and damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>THROWING</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with thrown weapons, and each time you attack with such a weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately draw another weapon after the attack.</p>
                <h5>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                <h5>TUNNEL FIGHTER</h5>
                <p>You excel at defending narrow passages, doorways, and other tight spaces. As a bonus action, you can enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you can make opportunity attacks without using your reaction, and you can use your reaction to make a melee attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet while within your reach.</p>
                <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
                <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.</p>

            <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</p>
            <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
            <p class="indent">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells. To cast one of your ranger spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of ranger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the ranger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of ranger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your ranger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level ranger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell animal friendship, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of ranger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p class="indent">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>Spell save DC = 8</b> + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b>Spell attack modifier =</b> your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
            </p>
            <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
            <p class="indent">You can cast a ranger spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

            <p>You have a knack dealing with beasts and making them follow your commands. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
                <li>You gain expertise in the Animal Handling skill, doubling your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses that proficiency.</li>
                <li>In addition, you learn animal friendship and beast bond, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for both spells.</li>
