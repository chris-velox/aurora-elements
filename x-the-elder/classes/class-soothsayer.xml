        <description>
            <p>Apearing poor and beaten down, a young human girl tugs at an elder man’s coat, begging for some coin. The man agrees, and before he knows it, he awakes to find himself lost within the woods.</p>
            <p class="indent">Wielding the spirits of her forefathers, a bright-eyed gnome sacrifices the power of her blood to heal her allies and keep them alive in their fight against a powerful lich lord.</p>
            <p class="indent">Seething with anger, a dwarf unleashes his rage, causing a mass frenzy wherein he feasts on the screams of terror as bodies fall to the ground.</p>
            <p class="indent">Standing completely still in a fervent marketplace while citizens run for their lives, a brutish half-orc looks content as his eyes gaze upon the current decimation he had seen previously in his worst nightmares. "This day will be my last" he thinks to himself, and releases a powerful spell to sheild others from the wrath of the apocalypse as he himself is swept up and destroyed by it.</p>
            <h4>SCIONS OF FATE</h4>
            <p>Both feared and respected, Soothsayers hold unique abilities whether gifted or trained, to peer past the current situation and discover a new strategy. They learn to use this ability to either warn locals or save themselves, getting out while the going’s good, so to say.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some soothsayers are fully engulfed within this power over time, and take a devious perogative to bend the future to their liking.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SOOTHSAYER</h4>
            <p>As you create your Soothsayer character, consider how or why you acquired your abilities. Did witnessing the death of a loved one push you along the track for revenge at any cost? Were you part of a crime syndicate that teaches situational magics? or have you always had the ability to sense what is unknown to others due to a magical bloodline? Perhaps you served a fiendish master and wish to outsmart them out of fear for your safety.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 2nd level, Soothsayers pick their altered path, a subclass that sticks them into numerous tests of deciscion-making and puzzle-solving. The life of a Soothsayer is wrought with mental hardships and your character needs a solid reason to pick this path of dodging mental instability and visions of an altered world.</p>
            <h4>QUICK BUILD</h4>
            <p>You can make a soothsayer quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity (Some Soothsayers who seek a more direct approach may swap the order of these scores.) Second, choose the Haunted One background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you have been cursed with a hunger for what lies beyond. This hunger is represented by Sanity Points, which allow you to unlock a toolbox of unique effects.</p>
                <h5>SANITY POINTS</h5>
                <p>You have 2 sanity points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sanity Points column of the Soothsayer table. You can never have more sanity points than what is shown on the table. You regain all spent spent sanity points after finishing a short or long rest.</p>
                <h5>ALTERED POWERS</h5>
                <p>You have acquired specialized powers of a supernatural origin that allow you to sacrifice pieces of your soul and mind to peer beyond the thin veil of reality. However you gained these powers, they are what fuels your spellcasting. See the general rules of spellcasting in the 5th edition <em>Player’s Handbook</em> and page 5 of this document for the soothsayer spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use your sanity points to cast spells in place of regular spell slots by expending a number equal to the spell’s level. Spells cast this way can be cast either as an action, bonus action, or reaction (regardless of the spell’s casting time). Expending sanity points in this way casts the spell in that moment, and any ritual spells cast using sanity points are cast as a bonus action.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Mental Crux class feature from the soothsayer class, you can use sanity points to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast soothsayer spells you know.</p>
                <h5>RUNNING OUT OF SANITY POINTS</h5>
                <p>When a soothsayer runs out of sanity points, they roll a d10 and suffer an effect according to the temporary insanity table. This effect lasts until the soothsayer regains at least 1 sanity point from either meditating for 10 minutes, or by finishing a short or long rest.</p>
                <h5>MEDITATION</h5>
                <p>A soothsayer can spend 10 minutes readjusting themselves to the material plane to regain 1 sanity point.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st level spells of your choice from the soothsayer spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Soothsayer table shows when you learn more soothsayer spells of your choice. Each of those spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 9th level, for example, you can learn a new soothsayer spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your soothsayer spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a soothsayer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                </center>

Expending sanity points in this way casts the spell in that moment, and any ritual spells cast using sanity points are cast as a bonus action.

If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn’t return.</p>
