        <description>
            <p>A man with his brain exposed begins glowing as the objects in the room around him float, suddenly, seemingly by a force of wind, each of the floating objects begin flying directly towards his assassins. A kobold cackles manically as her enemies begin psychically catching fire. The old gnomish man stands in his classroom, teaching a new generation of Telepaths solely through his mind.</p>
            <p class="indent">Unlike wizards who spend their time studying the arcane arts to learn to cast spells, the Telepath studies the arts of the mind and uses it to develop psychic powers. As a Telepath, you will manipulate the powers of your mind to alter the world around you in many different ways such as creating fires, lifting heavy objects, or predicting the future.</p>
            <h4>THE STUDY OF THE MIND</h4>
            <p>Telepaths are concerned about improving their psychic abilities and learning how to use them to command the world around them, gaining control of themselves, or power over others. It is important to understand that while their abilities are learned just like magic, the Telepath does not cast spells using arcane study. They instead use their intellect to gain control over their innate powers and psychically channel them into a physical force.</p>
            <h4>THE POWER INSIDE</h4>
            <p>Unlike Sorcerers, every technically intelligent creature has the ability to access psychic powers with hard dedication and study, however, some creatures are inherently better at it than others, such as a High Elf being able to perform telepathic abilities at a much earlier age due to their natural intellect.</p>
            <p class="indent">While psychic powers are innate in every creature, they are accessed by gaining control over the mind. However, the mind is a fragile thing, and sometimes, you can discover early developments of psychic abilities from an outburst of some kind.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A TELEPATH</h4>
            <p>When creating your Telepath, think about what kind of Telepath you are and how you came to discover your innate psychic abilities. Perhaps the local fortune teller adopted you and taught you the ways of clairvoyance. Maybe in a fit of rage, your psychic powers lit your family home ablaze and you learned that you have the ability to become a Pyrokinetic.</p>
            <p class="indent">After you understand how you came to become a Telepath, a good question to ask is how your character became an adventurer. Did you want to use your psychic powers to save people? Did you want to learn the secrets of the telepathic arts and become a master of the mind? Perhaps you seek revenge against a community that shunned you for a sudden psychic outburst you could not control.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a 1st level Telepath quickly by following these suggestions. First, intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by constitution. Second, select the Acolyte background.</p>

                <p>Starting at 1st level, your psychic abilities manifest in the form of a sphere that is centered around you. The majority of the telepath’s abilities are focused around this aura. The aura can be activated or deactivated as a bonus action. The range of your psychic aura increases as you gain more telepath levels as displayed in the Aura Range column of the telepath class table. Additionally, starting at 1st level, you can perform two of the most basic telepath feats, a Psychic Strike and Basic Telepathy.</p>

This attack can be flavored to take any form such as a floating weapon or a ghost-like hand. The range of this attack is equal to your psychic aura’s range. On a hit, a target creature takes 1d10 force damage. You may add your Intelligence modifier to your psychic strike’s attack and damage rolls rather than your Strength modifier.</p>

You may only use this to communicate with one creature in your psychic aura at a time and only if that creature understands at least one language or can speak telepathically itself. A creature you are speaking to telepathically can respond so long as it is in your psychic aura.</p>
                    <p class="indent">When you are speaking to a creature that you do not share a language with, you may attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to communicate your intentions, ideas, and feelings with the creature as best you can and vice verca.

For example, if the target creature’s intelligence score is 8 and you do not share a language with it, the DC to communicate clearly with them is 14.</p>

This sound can be as loud as six times their normal voice’s volume or completely silent. You may also change the sounds a creature themselves creates such as causing them to sound as if they speak a different language, changing the tone of their words to make them sound rude or aggressive, making a creature speak new words they did not mean to speak, making mundane sounds such as footsteps sound differently, or changing their pitch. You may use any combination of these effects on a creatures voice and may change the effects at will. If a creature is unwilling to have their voice changed, they must succeed a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you will be able to affect a creature with this feature for 1 minute. After the duration has past, a creature may re-attempt the saving throw.</p>
