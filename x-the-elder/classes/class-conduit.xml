        <description>
            <p>A tavern-bound old man turns down an alleyway, but suddenly feels a blade pressed against his neck. Purple smoke seeps from his wrinkled fist as the thief tells him to empty his coinpurse. Upon hearing the sounds of a scuffle, a nearby guard runs to the alley. However, all he finds is an elder out for a stroll. No trace of the brigand could be seen.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tendrils erupt from the arm of a tiefling and grab hold of a trembling kobold. She lifts the creature just above the ground while politely asking where all the treasures she came for had gone. Since the reptile is too frightened to answer, the tiefling touches a finger to his forehead, blinks twice, and thanks him before tossing him aside.</p>
            <p class="indent">A huge maul, seemingly appearing from nowhere, drops into the grasp of a half-orc. She swings the weapon just as her hands clutch it, striking true on an encroaching owlbear. The maul then disappears, just as quickly as it came, as the monster struggles to hobble away. The half-orc turns back towards her village’s gate and smirks to herself.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each conduit was gifted with a blessing, or a curse, that destined them for a life of adventuring. Some source of extraordinary power merged with their body, thereby allowing the conduit to utilize amazing powers from that point forward.</p>
            <h4>LOCUS OF POWER</h4>
            <p>Conduits learn to control their power quite quickly, since it is just another part of them. Once they understand the basics, they can partially externalize and manipulate their inner power. When this happens, one or two of their extremities take on a unique appearance and become a locus. These loci can come in a multitude of forms that the conduit learns and cultivates through their personal experiences.</p>
            <p class="indent">A conduit’s locus also allows them to cast spells. Using magic this way can leave them feeling drained, so conduits tend to use this part of their power sparingly. Naturally, it takes patience and confidence to use these abilities well.</p>
            <h4>GIFT ORIGINS IN MANY WORLDS</h4>
            <p>The source of a conduit’s power, which can be received in a variety of ways, is called their gift. In the Forgotten Realms, conduits are considered a rare subset of sorcerers, meaning that they hold their gift from birth. In Eberron and Ravnica, technological or magical experimentation on creatures can create conduits. In other worlds, conduits might be purposely created for military purposes or only ever seen when ancient, forbidden magicks provide a creature with an esoteric gift.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A CONDUIT</h4>
            <p>Start by thinking about the source of your character’s inner power. If you’d rather leave it to chance, you can use the Gift Source table presented later in the class description.</p>
            <p class="indent">When filling out your character sheet, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Conduit table to see which features you get at each level. The descriptions of those features appear in the "Conduit Features" section.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a conduit quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by your choice of Charisma, Intellgience, or Wisdom. Second, choose the folk hero background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a conduit, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per conduit level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per conduit level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled mb">
                <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> None</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution, Charisma</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, History, Intimidation, Religion, Sleight of Hand, and Survival</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>either (a) a martial melee weapon or (b) a component pouch</li>
                <li>a sling and a pouch containing 20 sling bullets</li>
                <li>your choice of (a) studded leather armor or (b) scale mail</li>
                <li>your choice of (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.</p>
            <h3>MULTICLASSING</h3>
            <p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Players Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose conduit as one of your classes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Ability Score Minimum.</i></b> As a multiclass character, you must have a Strength or Dexterity score of at least 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a conduit.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Proficiencies Gained.</i></b> If conduit isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a conduit: light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> Add half of your levels (rounded up) in the conduit class to the appropriate levels from other classes (i.e., the warlock class) to determine your available spell slots.</p>

                <p class="flavor">1st-level conduit feature</p>
                <p class="indent">As long as you are able to activate your locus, you can use the energy of your gift to cast spells. However, your magic does not appear in the same way as that of wizards or sorcerers; instead, it alters the appearance of your locus as it physically flows out from your extremities.</p>
                <h5>LOCUS REQUIRED</h5>
                <p>Your magical effects are produced through your locus. You must have an empty hand when you cast any spell with this Pact Magic feature (meaning the spell has an "S" component when you cast it).</p>
                <p class="indent">After you gain the Locus Forms feature at 2nd level, you can also use any active locus form to fulfill this requirement.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The conduit table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows the level of those slots; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your conduit spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain any expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell color spray, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the conduit spell list. The Spells Known column of the Conduit table shows when you learn more conduit spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 7th level, for example, you learn a new conduit spell, which can be 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the conduit spells you know and replace it with another spell from the conduit spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Conduits receive their supernatural gifts from a variety of sources. These different sources require different types of mental fortitude in order to be utilized well, meaning that conduits do not always share a common spellcasting ability. You instead choose your spellcasting ability from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Alternatively, you can determine it randomly by using the Gift Source table. Once chosen, your spellcasting ability for this class cannot be changed.</p>
                <p class="indent">You use the chosen ability whenever a conduit feature or spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use its modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a conduit spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability modifier</p>
                <h5>CONDUIT SPELL LIST</h5>
                <p>Here’s the list of spells you consult when you learn a conduit spell. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. Each spell is in the Player’s Handbook, unless it has one asterisk (a spell in Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything) or two asterisks (a spell in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything).</p>
                <h5 class="caption">Gift Source</h5>
                <table>

                    <tr><td>3</td><td>Charisma. Your gift is actually a mythical creature held within your very body. Leeching its power for yourself has become a habit, for better or worse.</td></tr>

                <p class="indent">Your locus is more than just a part of you: it is a multi-tool for solving the countless obstacles you face as an adventurer.</p>
                <p class="indent">You know three locus forms of your choice. Your options are detailed in the "Locus Forms" section at the end of the class description, where you will also find the general rules of locus form activation. When you gain certain conduit levels, you gain additional forms of your choice, as shown in the Locus Forms Known column of the Conduit table.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the forms you know and replace it with another form that you could learn at that level.</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5 class="caption">Locus Forms</h5>
                    <p>Each form description begins with a block of information, including the form’s name, prerequisites, activation time, range, somatic requirement, and duration. The rest of the entry describes the form’s effect.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Prerequisites.</i></b> If a locus form has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the form at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Activation Time.</i></b> Many locus forms require a single bonus action to activate, but some forms require an action or a reaction to activate.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Range.</i></b> The target of a locus form must be within the form’s range. Some forms have ranges expressed in feet. Other forms can target only a creature or object that you touch. Other forms, such as the bolster form, affect only you. These forms have a range of self.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Somatic Requirement.</i></b> Each locus form requires one or two of your hands to be empty in order to be activated. While a form is active, the hand(s) that you used to activate it can’t be used for anything outside the scope of that form’s effects.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Duration.</i></b> A locus form’s duration is the length of time that it can persist before deactivating on its own. Duration can be expressed in rounds or minutes, but many forms are instantaneous: the form harms or alters a creature or an object in a way that only requires it to be active for an instant. Some forms specify that their effects last until the forms are deactivated. You can deactivate one of your active locus forms at any time on your turn (no action required). If you become incapacitated, your active forms deactivate instantly.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Saving Throws.</i></b> Some of your locus forms require your target to make a saving throw to resist the form’s effects. The saving throw DC is equal to your spell save DC for this class.</p>

                <p class="indent">Whether in a warm tavern or on a snowswept peak, your gift makes sure you always have what you need on hand. As an action, you can conjure one piece of Adventuring Gear—such as one arrow or one day’s rations—from the opening of an opaque container within your reach. For examples of items you can create, see the Adventuring Gear table in the equipment chapter of the Player’s Handbook. If the item can’t fit in your hand, it appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The gp value of the item can’t be more than 5 times your conduit level, which is also your gp limit for this feature.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can conjure multiple items this way, using a separate action for each one, but their sum total value can’t surpass the gp limit. Any item valued under 1 gp instead has a value of 1 gp for this limit. A potion of healing has a value of 10 gp for this limit. You can also conjure a gaming set or musical instrument that you are proficient with, treating its value as 2 gp for this limit regardless of its normal value.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you finish your next long rest, each item conjured this way disappears if it hasn’t already been consumed or destroyed, and your sum total value of conjured items returns to 0 gp.</p>

            <p>The Bond of the Lionheart is a relationship that spurs one to action. Conduits with this bond carry one of two specific motivations: a duty to help others or a desire to conquer them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless, lionhearts share a confidence that people can’t ignore. If they live long enough to make a name for themselves, these conduits become heroes and villains of legend.</p>

                <p class="indent">You touch a creature that has a speed of 0, is incapacitated, or is willing. You then force it to remember a subject that you choose, such as its boss, a treasure, or last night’s dinner. One of its relevant memories, no longer than 6 seconds, then surfaces in the creature’s mind as well as your own. If the memory includes speech, it is limited to 15 words or less.</p>
                <p class="indent">The memory’s detail and level of accuracy both depend on the creature’s Intelligence and sanity. For example, using this form on a pet might allow you to visualize the owner, but their speech would be heard as unintelligible gibberish if the pet does not comprehend their language.</p>
                <p class="indent">Repeated use of this form on the same creature makes subsequent memories more obscured than the last, with them becoming incomprehensible after three such uses. This effect is reset after 24 hours of not being affected by the form.</p>

                <p class="indent">When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can activate this form and create a locus weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook for weapon options). You are proficient with it and can’t be disarmed of it while you wield it. If you plan to engage in two-weapon fighting, you can create two locus weapons at once, assuming you have two empty hands to work with.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you can make multiple attacks as part of the Attack action, you can freely change the form of your locus weapon or create a new one before each attack. At the end of your turn, all of your locus weapons retract back into your locus and disappear.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your locus can assimilate a magic melee weapon and turn it into a locus weapon by accommodating the weapon over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your grasp during this time. After 1 hour, the weapon melds with your locus and becomes a locus weapon for you, allowing you to choose it whenever you create a locus weapon. You can’t affect an artifact weapon in this way. If the weapon is sentient, you must gain its consent before accommodating it. Sentient locus weapons share your senses and can converse telepathically with you.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can have up to three accommodated weapons. If you attempt to accommodate a fourth magic weapon, you must reconstitute one of the other three. That weapon appears at your feet and ceases to be one of your locus weapons. If you die, your accommodated weapons reconstitute immediately.</p>
