        <description>
            <p>A young tiefling girl pours through a book of basic spells, hidden away in the back of a library and rarely checked out by the residents of her village. Though she never learned the letters, she understands their meaning instinctually. As she traces the symbol they describe, a flower appears in her hand. She places it among the bouquet she has conjured over the course of the evening, each flower subtly longer and richer in color than the last.</p>
            <p class="indent">Children drag their parents through a town square, toward a garishly dressed half-orc making every effort to be seen. As he conjures explosions of light and illusion, the children are delighted and the parents reward him for brightening their day, tossing a silver piece into the hat he has set out. None of them see the spectral hand he has conjured behind them, ensuring their donation will be more generous than expected.</p>
            <p class="indent">A lone tabaxi flits through sun-dappled ruins, an ancient treasure firmly latched to her belt and its reanimated guardian hot on her trail. She draws an arrow from her quiver and focuses on it briefly before turning with a quick flourish and firing at her pursuer. The arrow finds its mark, and ice erupts from it, impeding the guardian’s movement long enough for her to escape to safety.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hedge Mages are magic users that lack formal training, often found among common folk that might never discover their talent or be able to access magical education. Instead, they study and learn magic themselves through hard work and determination. This power is not innate to them - it must be discovered and carefully refined, as best they can by themselves, or taught only by the similarly limited. Though they might never achieve the might or esteem available to those who are born with aptitude or are taught the breadth of magic, they master the fundamentals and achieve their own particular type of power.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Hedge Mage spell list. You learn additional Hedge Mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Hedge Mage table.</p>

                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Hedge Mage spells, since you learn your spells through introspection and personal discovery. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Hedge Mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

You add your Intelligence modifier to ranged weapon attack rolls with simple or martial ranged weapons. You can also fully project your consciousness into an arrow, dart, or crossbow bolt as you fire it. For 1 minute you can control the trajectory of the projectile and can see and hear as if you were in the projectile’s location as it travels, though you have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks while doing so due to the speed of travel. The effect ends if the projectile stops moving, and the projectile falls to the ground at the end of the duration or when it has traveled a distance equal to ten times the firing weapon’s long range.</p>

A seal holds for 1 minute and a target can only be affected by one seal at a time and the seal dissipates after the target attempts this saving throw. You can seal magic in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored when you finish a long rest.</p>
