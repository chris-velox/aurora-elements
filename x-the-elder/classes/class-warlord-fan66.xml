        <description>
            <p>The shrewd, armored elf stands in the back watching the carnage of battle unfold. Studying the field like a chessboard, she quickly notices gaps in the enemy’s defense. After shouting commands to her allies, her strategic insights lead to victory.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a hydra threatens adventurers with death, a human clad in plate armor shouts words of encouragement before charging the hydra. Inspired by his bravery, his companions join him in the face of impossible odds.</p>
            <p class="indent">The opposing army quickly forms a defensive position against the incoming dragonborn batallion. The hulking dragonborn leader steps forward to let out a might draconic roar that sends chills down the defenders’ neck. As the terrifying dragonborn leads his men forward, the defenders flee in terror.</p>
            <p class="indent">All of these warriors are warlords, excellent leaders in combat. Although all warlords exceed at helping their allies achieve victory, each has a distinct style of leadership. Some prefer to fight alongside their companions to inspire their allies or terrify their foes. Other warlords prefer to never lift a weapon but guide their companions with their sheer presence or words.</p>
            <h4>MOTIVATION TO LEAD</h4>
            <p>A warlord is not a regular combatant. Although trained in fighting, a warlord’s true strength lies with their ability to lead their allies. When choosing to play a warlord, carefully consider your motivations for leadership. Some warlords come from noble lineage and were trained from a young age to be a natural leader. Others might have acquired their skills as an officer or mercenary captain in a military campaign. Perhaps your warlord is a minor warchief seeking glory or a cunning marshal of the borderlands defending the frontier.</p>
            <h4>PATHS TO VICTORY</h4>
            <p>All warlords are talented leaders, but their leadership might manifest in different ways. Some warlords might inspire their allies to great heights, while others might terrify their foes to soften them up. Others might prefer more cunning or tactical approaches. Regardless of a warlord’s style, their leadership pushes their allies to become unbeatable. A warlord helps their companions exceed their mortal limits and become legend.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A WARLORD</h4>
            <p>As you build your warlord, think of two points of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what motivates you to lead others? What is your leadershp style? Are you a charismatic warlord that inspires their allies with your presence? Are you a wise warlord whose experience is invaluable in a fight? Or are you a cunning leader that plays their companions like chess pieces?</p>
            <p class="indent">These are all viable paths of being a warlord, but you must choose your Leadership Style at level 1. This choice will reflect how your character might act in combat and out of combat.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a warlord quickly by following these suggestions. First, choose your archetype and make your archetype’s Leadership Style attribute your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity or Strength, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Second, choose the noble or soldier background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an warlord, you gain the following class features.</p>

            <description>
                <p>By 3rd level, you have learned arcane magic through careful studies as a wizard does. See the Player’s Handbook on Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Arcane Centurion spell list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and conjuration spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Arcane Centurion Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or conjuration spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or conjuration spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Arcane Centurion spells, since your magic reflects your arcane studies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Arcane Centurion spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="align-text: center;"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="align-text: center;"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p class="indent">See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>
