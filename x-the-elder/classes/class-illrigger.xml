        <description>
            <p>The Lords of the Nine Cities of Hell scheme and plot endlessly, eternally. Each seeks to bring the others to heel, and ascend to the Throne of Hell, uniting the nine cities and every infernal thing that lives there, leading an infinite army of devils across the timescape until all worlds burn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Their elite shock troops, the terror-commandos of Hell, are the Illriggers. Knights of Hell, they are high charisma counter-paladins who master devils and cast their own unique spells.</p>
            <h4>THE ORDER OF DESOLATION</h4>
            <p>Acceptance into the Order of Illriggers makes you a comrade with every other illrigger, regardless of which Archdevil you serve. Each Archdevil has churches, underground fanes, secret societies, cults. All with leaders manically devoted to the Archdevil who grants them their power. But the association of Illriggers consider themselves each more alike to the others in the order than to the priests and warlocks who serve the same master.</p>
            <p class="indent">Members of the Order of Desolation, also known as the Desolate or the Knights of Desecration, are expected to be intelligent, resourceful, tactical, manipulative. A temple or cult may believe that the presence of an Illrigger in their midst is a sign that their Archdevil approves on their actions, but the Illriggers are independent. They serve no order, no hierarchy, no authority but the Archdevil themselves and pride themselves on being separate from all other organizations. It is not unusual, therefore, for a member of the Order of Desolation to seek help, and find it, from other members of order first, even from Illriggers who serve other Archdevils before going to any church, cult, or temple to their own archdevil.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an illrigger, you gain the following class features.</p>

                <p>There is a well of infernal power within you that replenishes after you take a long rest. With this well, you can transfer hit points between yourself and other creatures. You can transfer a number of hit points equal to your illrigger level x 4.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action, you can touch a willing creature to either heal yourself by dealing necrotic damage to that creature or heal the creature by dealing necrotic damage to yourself. You can draw a number of hit points to transfer in this way from your pool, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can also target an unwilling creature. When you do so, the target must make a Constitution save. On a success, they are unaffected and immune to this feature for the next 24 hours. On a failure, the creature is effected as though they were willing.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you are at maximum hit points and drain hit points from a creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to the amount you drained. You can not give another creature temporary hit points in this way.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 9th level, you can choose to remove a level of exhaustion by spending 4 points from your pool. Alternatively, you can spend 4 points to bestow a level of exhaustion on a creature.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 13th level, when a creature is effected by your infernal conduit, you learn the emotional state and surface level thoughts of the creature. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made against the creature for the next hour.</p>

            <description>
                <p>By 2nd level, you have learned to compel your patron Archdevil to grant you arcane magic to cast spells.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>The illrigger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your illrigger spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of illrigger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the illrigger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of illrigger spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your illrigger level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th-level illrigger, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell hell’s lash, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot.</p>
                <p class="indent">Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of illrigger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your illrigger spells, since their power derives from your ability to command the attention of your patron archdevil. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an illrigger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your illrigger spells.</p>

                <p>Upon reaching 2nd level, you learn to use the power granted by your Archdevil to censure other creatures. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to place a seal on a target within 30 feet of you.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you or an ally hit a sealed creature with a weapon attack, you can consume the seal to deal necrotic damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. This extra damage is 2d6 for a 1st-level spell, plus 1d6 for each spell-level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d6. The damage increases by 1d6 if the target is a celestial or fiend, to a maximum of 6d6. If you are within 30 feet of the creature when you consume your seal, you regain a hit point for each die of damage your seal inflicts.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your seal evaporates after one minute, if not consumed. Only the illrigger who placed the seal knows it’s there, it appears in the illrigger’s sight as a glowing glyph on the creature’s forehead.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Becoming a Knight of Hell involves pledging yourself to the infernal authorities. At 3rd level, your devotion has been noticed by an archdevil, who chooses you to become one of their knightly servants. This honor comes with a suite of powers to better serve your infernal master.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 3rd level you pledge your soul to the service of an archdevil and are welcomed into the Order of Desolation, becoming an illrigger. You gain the Invoke Authority feature and choose either Shadowmaster (Moloch), Painkiller (Dispater) or Architect of Ruin (Asmodeus), all detailed at the end of the class description.</p>
                <p class="indent">Furthermore, you are a noble in the lists of Hell and will be accorded fine treatment and hospitality anywhere in hell you travel, even to cities ruled by enemy Archdevils. More cosmopolitan cities in the timescape--like Alloy, the City of Brass--will also respect your noble rank.</p>
                <h5>AUTHORITY SPELLS</h5>
                <p>Each of the Lords of Hell grant different spells to their elite death commandos. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the Invoke Authority description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Authority spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you gain an authority spell that doesn’t appear on the illrigger spell list, the spell is nonetheless an illrigger spell for you.</p>
                <h5>INVOKE AUTHORITY</h5>
                <p>You invoke the authority granted you by your Archdevil lord, channelling baleful energy to fuel magical effects. Each Invoke Authority option provided by your Archdevil explains how to use it.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you use your Invoke Authority, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Invoke Authority again.</p>
                <p class="indent">Some Invoke Authority effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your illrigger spell save DC.</p>

                <p>Choose a creature within range that has your seal on it. Until the spell ends, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw before making an attack against you. On a failed save, the creature loses the attack. On a successful save, the creature can make the attack as normal, but takes necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>

                <p>You manifest a mote of Hell on the Mundane world. A 15-foot radius sphere of darkness, brimstone, and blasting heat arrives, centered on a point within range and lasting for the duration of the spell. The cloud of hellfire echoes with the cries of damned souls that can be heard by anyone within 30 feet of the cloud.</p>
                <p class="indent">No light, even magical light, can illuminate the area and any creatures fully within the area are blinded. The cloud warps the timescape and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 fire damage. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage as the voices of the damned crowd their mind.</p>
