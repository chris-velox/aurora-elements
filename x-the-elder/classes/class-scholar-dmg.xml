        <description>
            <p>A human general, clad in gleaming armor, studies the map on the table in front of him, covered in figurines that represent units of his soldiers and invading orcs. He consults a leather-bound journal filled with notes he’s made on the enemy’s tribe, their customs and battle tactics, and he moves two pieces confidently forward.</p>
            <p class="indent">A wild-haired dwarf stands at the head of a long caravan. She surveys the valley below and plots their course through the untamed wilds. Unrolling a sheaf of parchment, she sketches in new features on an expertly drawn map and then motions for the caravan to follow, leading them deeper into unknown territory in search of treasure and knowledge.</p>
            <p class="indent">The halfling’s medical kit opens with a snap, and he quickly starts removing instruments and vials as he looks over his patient, coming to a diagnosis as he observes her symptoms. He mixes a tincture and applies a salve to her lesions. Her condition is advanced, but not beyond his skills. As he administers the treatment he glances up and sees his next patient coming through the door, nursing a wrist bent to an odd angle. He reaches into his bag for a splint as he takes back the vial with his tincture.</p>
            <h4>GREAT MINDS</h4>
            <p>While many sages and academics dedicate their great minds to unraveling the mysteries of the divine or the arcane, scholars usually focus their intellectual efforts on the mundane. They look to the physical world around them and marvel at the wonders it holds.</p>
            <p class="indent">A scholar’s true devotion is to understanding. Real knowledge pushes beyond trivia, from the what to the why and how. This distinction is critical to scholars, a defining aspect of the curiosity that drives them to learn and to adventure. The wisest among them realizes that, while there may be no unsolvable mysteries, no single mortal can hope to solve them all. And so, for many, learning is a lifelong pursuit.</p>
            <p class="indent">For the truly curious, the adventuring life is the only way to expand one’s horizons of knowledge and build one’s skill. Any scholar worth his salt will agree that libraries and laboratories are excellent avenues for learning, but no books or beakers contain the knowledge still waiting to be discovered beyond the frontier or in the crucible of battle. The scholar believes that every student reaches a point where the most effective path to higher learning is hands-on experience. The world is full of discoveries waiting to be made.</p>
            <p class="indent">While most scholars have broad intellectual interests, all of them pursue a particular field of expertise to which they have likely dedicated years of study before becoming adventurers. The pursuits are widely varied, but there are still many characteristics that are shared by all scholars. For example, though not all scholars will relish the opportunity to fight, all of them possess a keen intellect that allows them to exploit opportunities on the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">Typically, a scholar will make his or her biggest contributions to an adventuring party outside of combat. Their knowledge, expertise, and breadth of proficiencies make them valuable in a myriad of situations that adventurers find themselves in.</p>
            <p class="indent">As you create your scholar character, consider how your character first set out upon the academic path. Consider where they learned, who taught them, and why they follow the path still. The following sections offer ways to give depth and history to your scholar.</p>
            <div element="ID_KG_SCHOLAR_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_SCHOLAR_AN_EDUCATION_BEGINS" />
            <div element="ID_KG_SCHOLAR_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_SCHOLAR_PLACE_OF_STUDY" />

            <div element="ID_KG_SCHOLAR_BACKGROUND_FEATURE_SCHOLAR_PHILOSOPHY_OF_SCHOLARSHIP" />
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. (Some scholars who focus on melee combat make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the sage background.</p>
            <h2>MULTICLASSING</h2>
            <p>A character wishing to multiclass into or out of the scholar class must have an Intelligence score of 13 or higher.</p>
            <p class="indent">When multiclassing into scholar from another class, you gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, and one skill from the scholar skill list.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an scholar, you gain the following class features.</p>

                <p>At first level, you gain the ability to use your quick wits to your advantage both in and out of combat. You learn gambits that are fueled by special dice called intellect dice. Gambits allow you to bring your mind to bear in order to solve problems, and to create and exploit opportunities that others cannot see.</p>
                <h5>GAMBITS</h5>
                <p>You know all the gambits listed under "Gambits" below, and may learn another at a later level, unique to your Pursuit. Many gambits enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack.</p>
                <h5>INTELLECT DICE</h5>
                <p>You have a number of intellect dice equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of one), which are d8s. An intellect die is expended when you use a gambit, and you regain all expended intellect dice when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>SAVING THROWS</h5>
                <p>Some gambits require your target to make a saving throw to resist its effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Gambit save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <h5>GAMBITS</h5>
                <p>The gambits are presented in alphabetical order.</p>

                <p>Scholars choose their areas of focus well before becoming adventurers, versing themselves in the research and theory relevant to their field. A drive to further this mastery, and add to the body of knowledge on their subject of interest, is often the impetus for a scholar to become an adventurer.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 1st level, you choose the scholarly pursuit on which you have focused your learning. Choose Explorer, Inventor, Philosopher, Physician, Planar Sage, or Tactician, detailed at the end of the class description. The pursuit you choose grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 13th, and 18th level.</p>

        <description>
            <p>The Inventor pursuit is taken up by scholars who are creators at heart. More than mere artisans, Inventors draw upon their intellect and a broad array of tools and disciplines to create things which are wholly new.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">CREATING CREATIVE CREATIONS</h5>
                <p>Using the instructions provided here will allow you to create inventions that are mechanically complete but intentionally devoid of concrete description for how they look, work, and even what level of technology they represent. It is up to you to supply these details with the cooperation of your DM.</p>
                <p class="indent">When creating flavor for your inventions, keep in mind the level of technological sophistication that is appropriate for the setting you are playing in, so that your inventions feel plausible in the context of the adventure. Some invention types, such as the clockwork companion, may not be suitable for settings with particularly low levels of technology. When creating an Inventor scholar, discuss this ahead of time with your DM so that neither of you is surprised.</p>
                <p class="indent">Most inventions can be described using a wide range of technology levels. For example, the right weapon invention could be described as a revolver, a repeating crossbow, or a multibarreled blowgun.</p>
                <p class="indent">Hundreds of unique inventions can be created with these rules, but with your DM’s permission you can break free from the blueprints laid out here and invent something completely new.</p>

                <p>At 6th level you learn the forceful presence gambit. While conversing with a creature that isn’t hostile to you, you can expend an intellect die as part of a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion ability check you make to interact with that creature. Add the intellect die to your ability check roll, and if you beat the creature’s opposing Wisdom (Insight) check the creature becomes charmed by you if you rolled Deception or Persuasion, or frightened of you if you rolled Intimidation. This condition lasts as long as you remain in the creature’s presence, and for 10 minutes afterward. The charmed condition ends early if you or your companions do anything harmful to the target.</p>

                <h5>SPELLBOOK</h5>
                <p>At 3rd level, once you acquire your first spellbook, you can scribe into it three 1st-level Planar Sage spells of your choice.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>The Planar Sage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast you spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of Planar Sage spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of Planar Sage spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your scholar level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you’re a 7th-level scholar, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell protection from evil and good, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Planar Sage spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Planar Sage spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Planar Sage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an arcane focus or a holy symbol (found in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook) for your Planar Sage spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">Learning Spells of 1st-Level and Higher. Each time you gain a scholar level, you can add one Planar Sage spell of your choice to your spellbook. This spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Planar Sage Spellcasting table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook. See the "Your Spellbook sidebar in the wizard description in the Player’s Handbook.</p>

                    <h5 class="caption">PLANAR SAGE VS WIZARD</h5>
                    <p>On the surface, the Planar Sage shares much in common with the wizard. They both record their spells in spellbooks and rely on their Intelligence to cast spells. But they diverge in important ways.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The Planar Sage is at once more focused and more generalized than the wizard. The Sage studies magic more holistically, exploring not just the arcane, but the divine and the elemental as well. They sacrifice the heights of power available to wizards and other dedicated casters like clerics and druids, but tap all sources of magical power equally.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Besides a scholarly interest in studying magic in all its facets, this broad approach is in service to the Planar Sage’s chosen field of study: the planes and the extraordinary beings that inhabit them. </p>

            <p><p>The scholar’s journey often begins at an early age. Children everywhere spend much of their time growing up learning about the ways of the world. For some, this learning may be narrow in scope: a trade, the village where they live, the local folklore.</p></p>
            <p class="indent">Most scholars were fortunate enough to have the privilege of a proper education in a place of learning, or at least the gumption and curiosity to turn a life on the streets into a learning experience. The circumstances of your birth and your background will likely have a significant influence on where you took your first steps on the path of the scholar.</p>

    <element name="Invention Type: Clockwork Companion" type="Archetype Feature" source="Kyle Grant’s Scholar" id="ID_KG_SCHOLAR_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_INVENTOR_INVENTION_CLOCKWORK_COMPANION">
        <description>
            <p>Design your clockwork companion by beginning with the statblock above and then modifying it with the properties below. For each category, select one of the available options.</p>
            <p class="indent">In combat, your companion acts on your turn and is not surprised if you are not surprised. It can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal if you tell it to do so with its Basic Communication Protocol feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can build your clockwork companion during a long rest using materials worth 100 gp. If it is destroyed, but its parts are recoverable, you can repair it using parts worth 25 gp.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Build Dynamics.</b> Your companion can have a light, heavy, or balanced build dynamic.</p>
            <p class="indent">A companion with a light build loses its reinforced +2 armor bonus, it’s Dexterity score increases by your Intelligence modifier, and its movement speed increases by 10 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">A companion with a heavy build has its reinforced armor bonus increased by 2 to +4, its Strength and Constitution scores both increase by half your Intelligence modifier, it gains 2 additional d4 hit dice, and its movement speed decreases by 10 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">A companion with a balanced build has its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores increase by half your Intelligence modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Locomotive Mechanism.</b> Your companion can have an increased walking speed or one of the following movement speeds: burrow, climb, fly, or swim.</p>
            <p class="indent">A companion with an increased walking speed has its speed increased by 20 ft. Otherwise, the companion’s new movement type has a speed equal to its walking speed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Secondary Functions.</b> Your companion is proficient with two of the following skills of your choice: Athletics, Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth. The companion uses your proficiency bonus instead of its own for these skills.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Utility Feature.</b> Your companion has one of the following utility features: contingency sensor, damage control, or transformation.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your companion has the contingency sensor property, you can put into an alert state as an action. When you do so, choose a simple trigger that the companion will wait for, and a simple action for it to carry out when it senses that trigger. For example, it could ring a bell when it senses a nearby creature. Its passive Perception increases by an amount equal to twice your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus while in this mode, and its speed is set to 0.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your companion has the damage control feature, when it is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half if it fails.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your companion has the transformation feature, you can use an action to have it reconfigure its form. This allows it to either swap the skill proficiencies it gains from the secondary functions feature, or the movement enhancement granted by the locomotive mechanism feature. Your companion is only capable of one type of transformation or the other, of your choice.</p>

    <element name="Invention Type: Combat Device" type="Archetype Feature" source="Kyle Grant’s Scholar" id="ID_KG_SCHOLAR_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_INVENTOR_INVENTION_COMBAT_DEVICE">
        <description>
            <p>Design your combat device by selecting properties in each of the categories below. If your combat device requires a saving throw, it uses your gambit save DC.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Durability.</b> The device can either be consumable or reusable.</p>
            <p class="indent">A consumable device requires 10 gp worth of materials to construct and it is destroyed after it is used. You can create a new one during a short rest, or three during a long rest, and you can maintain up to three at any one time.</p>
            <p class="indent">A reusable device requires 50 gp worth of materials to construct over a long rest, and it can be recovered after use. Once used, a reusable device must be reset during a short rest before it can be used again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Effect.</b> The device can inflict damage, a condition, or both. If the device deals damage, choose the type from following options: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, lightning, piercing, poison, slashing, or thunder. The conditions a device can inflict are blinded, deafened, grappled, and prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your device only deals damage, it deals a number of d8s equal to your proficiency bonus. If the device only inflicts conditions, choose two from the list of possible conditions. If your device does both, choose one condition and the device deals a number of d8s of damage equal to half your proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Activation.</b> The device can either be activated as an attack, as an action, or as a bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent">For a device activated with an attack, choose whether it is a melee attack with a reach of 5 feet or a ranged attack with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. Also choose whether the attack roll is made with Strength, Dexterity, or Intelligence. A device that inflicts damage with an attack does not have its effect modified in any way. A device that inflicts a condition with an attack, inflicts that condition until the end of the target’s next round.</p>
            <p class="indent">For a device activated with an action, choose Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution as a saving throw the target must make when targeted with the device. The range should be no more than 60 feet. If the device inflicts damage, it deals a number of extra d8s of damage equal to your proficiency bonus. On a successful saving throw, a target takes half damage. If the device inflicts a condition, the target can make a saving throw to resist and the condition lasts for one minute. An affected creature can make a saving throw to end the effect at the end of each of its turns.</p>
            <p class="indent">For a device activated with a bonus action, choose Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution as a saving throw the target must make when targeted with the device. The range should be no more than 30 feet. If the device inflicts damage, it deals a number of extra d8s of damage equal to half your proficiency bonus. On a successful saving throw, a target takes no damage. If the device inflicts a condition, the target can make a saving throw to resist and the condition lasts until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Target.</b> The device can target one creature or an area. A device that targets one creature does not have its effect modified in any way.</p>
            <p class="indent">A device that targets an area can have a 5-foot or 15-foot radius, and must be paired with an action or bonus action activation type. A device that inflicts damage within a 5-foot radius uses d6 damage dice instead of d8s. A device that inflicts damage within a 15-foot radius uses d4 damage dice instead of d8s, and the saving throw DC is 3 lower. A device that inflicts a condition within a 5-foot radius reduces its saving throw DC by 2, or by 5 in a 15-foot radius.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Design your improved tool by first selecting the kind of tool you would like to improve from the list of tools in the Player’s Handbook. You may choose any kind of tool besides vehicles and gaming sets. Once you have selected a type of tool, apply one of the enhancements from the list below.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your improved tool can be built from scratch with materials costing the same amount as a normal tool of that type during a long rest. Alternatively, you can modify an existing tool of that type for an amount equal to half of the price of that tool.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Automation.</b> The tool can work automatically if you spend ten minutes configuring it for the task at hand. It can make an ability check to complete its task using your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Ease of Use.</b> The tool can be used effectively even by someone not trained in its use. When a creature makes an ability check with the tool, it can add your proficiency bonus to the roll if the ability check doesn’t already include the creature’s proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Refinement.</b> The tool can improve the work of even a master. A creature proficient with that type of tool adds half your proficiency bonus to ability checks that use the tool in addition to any bonus granted by their own proficiency or expertise.</p>

    <element name="Invention Type: Skill Aid" type="Archetype Feature" source="Kyle Grant’s Scholar" id="ID_KG_SCHOLAR_ARCHETYPE_FEATURE_INVENTOR_INVENTION_SKILL_AID">
        <description>
            <p>Design your skill aid by first selecting the skill that you wish your invention to assist. You may choose any skill other than Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion. Once you have selected a skill, choose one of the effects for the aid from the list below.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your skill aid can be built with materials worth 50 gp over a long rest. If a creature using your skill aid to assist an ability check rolls a natural 1 on that check, the aid breaks. It can be repaired during a short or long rest with materials worth 25 gp.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Basic.</b> A creature trained in the use of this aid gains a bonus to ability checks that make use of it equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Enhanced.</b> A creature trained in the use of this aid can activate it as a bonus action to gain advantage on the next relevant ability check it makes before the end of its next turn. This function can be used twice before it needs to be reset during a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Powered.</b> A creature trained in the use of this aid can activate it as a bonus action and on the next relevant ability check it makes before the end of its next turn, it can treat the number on the die roll as a 20. The aid can be used once before it needs to be reset during a long rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Design your weapon by using each of the tables on the right to choose properties for it. Each property has a die modifier. When you’ve finished selecting properties, add the die modifiers together and consult the weapon damage table to determine the damage die for your weapon. If the die modifier total of the weapon appears in the ranges for two different damage dice options, you can choose which of the damage dice your weapon uses.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your invention is not considered simple or martial, and only you are considered proficient with it. At your DM’s discretion, you may be able to instruct someone in its use over a sufficiently long period of downtime.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can build your weapon during a long rest with materials worth 100 gp. If your weapon uses ammunition, choose whether it uses a standard ammunition type, such as arrows or sling bullets, or if it uses a unique ammunition type. If it uses unique ammunition, you can craft up to 10 pieces during a short rest. Each piece of ammunition requires materials worth 2 sp.</p>
