        <description>
            <p>A round-bellied halfling stirs the great iron pot, almost as large as he is, simmering over the embers of last night’s campfire. He lifts a portion of tender venison from the stew to taste before adding a pinch of salt and pepper from his pouch. The empty ladle finds the flank of the iron pot, rousing the rest of the adventuring party to breakfast with a clanging alarm. The predawn grumbling soon gives way to the licking of lips. They shall feast like kings on the hunt before diving into the necropolis hidden ahead.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human woman, cutting an intimidating figure in her armor of patchwork skins and scales, squats on the edge of a jagged outcrop. The chimera broken across the rocks offers a unique blend of meats she can use. She begins to skin and butcher the monster, already salivating at the thought of what thrills the meal will bring. The fiery glands in the throat she saves for last, handling them carefully. Surely there is some way to incorporate the mixture into a spicy goat curry...</p>
            <p class="indent">A drow sits in their make-up, resisting the urge to scratch at the pale stuff by sipping casually at their wine. The fools arranged around what they believe to be the table of a high elf diplomat are already many cups deep into their own. The kitchen doors swing open and the drow summons forth the servants bearing the main course - personally prepared before the arrival of the guests. They tuck in eagerly, tearing the food from the silver platters with uncivilized haste. One by one their eyes glaze over and they turn limply to the head of the table, awaiting instruction. The drow allows themselves a smile that cracks their alabaster mask open around the lips.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each of these figures is a gourmet. A cook, and more, who has sought out the strangest, finest ingredients in the world and transformed them through their own skill into wonders for the senses. Some cook to delight others, some for gain or glory, others yet pursue new tastes purely for the love of the craft. Each of them is a unique talent whose culinary experimentation has turned then into experts on certain parts of the natural world.</p>
            <h4>A TASTE FOR ADVENTURE</h4>
            <p>The best things in life are for the bold of heart: such is as true of cooking as it is of anything else. A gourmet has the soul of a chef, but they also hold the heart of an adventurer. Their passions are combined in an endless hunt for incredible and exotic ingredients to experiment with.</p>
            <p class="indent">What sets a gourmet apart from your common-or-garden cook is their view on - or rather, disregard for - civilised boundaries. A gourmet cares not for the stifling directions of the recipe book, but seeks inspiration in bizarre and even occasionally brilliant flavours. Their exploits cannot be contained in the kitchen: the most daring meals require daring souls who will visit far-off lands and tussle with terrible beasts, just for the chance to taste them as a well-seasoned steak.</p>
            <p class="indent">Gourmets maintain the same skills as travelling merchants and nomadic warriors. They are hardy folk that will happily forage grubs for weeks to survive, if it means seizing the opportunity for finding a new great taste.</p>
            <h4>FRESH INGREDIENTS</h4>
            <p>The fresher, the better: this is true of all cooking. And the adventuring gourmet is interested in a wide selection of wonderful meats, powders, seasoning and vegetation that can often only be found off the beaten path, to be best enjoyed that same night roasted over a crackling campfire.</p>
            <p class="indent">Eat what you kill - this is the mantra of a gourmet. With skilled hands they can skin and fillet any number of beasts and even monsters for food. A gourmet will try anything at least once. On the road they will gather an eclectic stock of ingredients that can be added to any meal in endless combination. The travelling chef must be a master of the medley, using what they have to its best.</p>
            <p class="indent">Using their incredible gifts as chefs, gourmets can draw out the nourishing powers of food in ways no other can come close to, working wonders in even the most trying of conditions.</p>
            <h4>THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY</h4>
            <p>Out on the road or busy hustling in an exotic city, oftentimes a body is lucky to get one square meal a day. A gourmet can ensure that this meal is made to count, turning the humblest rations into a feast that will start any day off right. Many a group of adventurers has won the day thanks only to the skills of their daring cook. Each gourmet hones their own menu of special recipes with distinct flavours and benefits. The lasting effects of a filling meal will depend on the particular training and instincts of the cook.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A GOURMET</h4>
            <p>When creating a gourmet, think about their connection to food and cooking. Do they love to serve others and see them satisfied, or do they seek out the most wonderful flavors for themselves? Were they formally trained, or did they learn through experimentation? Also consider what sets them apart from other cooks: their call to adventure. What drew them to take their craft on the road less traveled?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a gourmet quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Constitution your highest ability score. Your next highest score should be Wisdom. Choose Intelligence instead if you plan to pick the Aberrant Cuisine specialty. Finally, choose either the Folk Hero or Guild Artisan background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

                <p class="flavor">"Rather than be rich in gold or rich in friends, I only wish for riches enough to employ a good cook, so that I might - imagine! - get to dine on the richest delicacies until the end of my days."</p>
                <p style="text-align: right;">- Dalim Zhunn, the Lean Rogue of Ratsnest.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Gourmets are often unsung heroes; their gift of cooking taken for granted as an everyday necessity, as plain as bread or cheese. But they are not mere providers. Good food raises morale like nothing else, great food can dispel exhaustion as surely as a long night’s sleep in a downy bed - and truly inspired food excites the imagination and the senses. More than anything, the enjoyment of excellent cooking bonds those around the table.</p>
            <p class="indent">The typical image of a gourmet is the genial, jovial glue among eccentric, colorful heroes, supporting them in deeds great and small. But each gourmet has their own legacy to carve. Some live life largely as boisterous hosts, while others might stew quietly in personal turmoils, or be concocting grand ambitions for which their craft is a means to an end.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whoever they are, whatever the reasons they cook and adventure, the sections below offer a smorgasbord of ideas to help bring out the flavour of your gourmet character.</p>

            <description>
                <p>A good cook wastes not and wants not. Your ingredients come not only from the pantry, but also from the creatures you encounter on your adventures. As a gourmet, you can build up a stock of special dice called Ingredient Dice by harvesting slain creatures. These dice fuel your other abilities, detailed later in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent">At the end of each long rest, you gain a number of ingredient dice equal to 2 x your proficiency bonus, which are d6s. At 6th level, these ingredient dice turn into d8s. At 14th level, they turn into d10s.</p>
                <p class="indent">As an action while holding your cook’s utensils or a weapon that deals slashing damage, you can begin the process of harvesting additional ingredient dice from the remains of creatures within 5 feet of you, so long as they died within the last 24 hours and are one of the following types of creature: aberrations, beasts, dragons, elementals, fiends, fey, giants, humanoids, monstrosities, oozes, or plants. The process takes 2 minutes per creature.</p>
                <p class="indent">For each creature you successfully harvest, you gain an ingredient die equal to the size of its hit dice. For example, if you harvest a Tiny creature, you gain one ingredient die, which is a d4. If the creature was Small, the die is a d6, and so on. Ingredients harvested in this way serve as the key components of your dishes. It is assumed that you combine them with other sundries that you gather on your journey.</p>
                <p class="indent">The maximum number of ingredient dice you can store is shown in the Stock column of the Gourmet table. If you exceed your Stock maximum when you gain a new ingredient die, you must choose ingredient dice to discard until you no longer exceed it.</p>
                <div>
                    <h5 class="caption">ADDING INGREDIENTS TO YOUR STOCK</h5>
                    <p>Unlike class features such as Bardic Inspiration or a Monk’s ki points, your Stock is not guaranteed to be replenished to its maximum upon completing a short or long rest. Therefore, it is important for both players and DMs looking to use the Gourmet to consider the ease of access to this resource. If a campaign is likely to restrict the availability of creatures to harvest, consider allowing alternate methods to gather ingredients. For the right price, fresh ingredients could be bought in town. Exotic foodstuffs might also be looted from humanoids.</p>

                <p>Your culinary skills are crucial to extending the stamina of your adventuring party. Luckily, you have learnt to cook almost anywhere.</p>
                <p class="indent">As long as you have access to your cook’s utensils at the end of a long rest, you can expend any number of ingredient dice in your Stock to create a meal. A meal comprises a pool of temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + the total number rolled on the expended ingredient dice. You serve a number of temporary hit points to each creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your meal’s pool, which last until the start of a creature’s next long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">As you gain levels in this class, the quality of your cooking will improve and the value of your meal will multiply, as shown in the Meal Multiplier column of the Gourmet table. Apply this multiplier when determining the total pool of temporary hit points available for one of your meals.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, as an 5th-level gourmet with a Wisdom score of 17, you might roll 7 ingredient dice of varying sizes for a total of 27 points. Add your Wisdom modifier of 3, before applying your Meal Multiplier for a pool totaling 60 temporary hit points. You decide to serve the meal evenly amongst 3 creatures, granting each 20 temporary hit points.</p>

                <p>Every gourmet personalizes their craft. They may have been formally trained in a particular style of regional cuisine, or they might simply let their own tastes guide their work. As adventurers, gourmets find that their skillsets translate into an affinity with preparing different kinds of creatures. Gourmets are naturally inventive and experimental, with no two exactly alike in style. Nonetheless, they will generally fall into one of the categories described below.</p>

            <p>In a world filled with strange and dangerous monsters, it only took so long for reckless souls to ask: can you survive eating the sting of a manticore? And if so, what would it taste like? Gourmets who are known as specialists in monster cuisine are hardy (and often heavily-scarred) cooks who are as ready to wrestle gorgons as they are to knead dough. They are the first to try untested, possibly poisonous, ingredients, and dive into the lairs of local horrors without hesitation to follow the rumour of a new ingredient. To them, a dare is as good as an order from a paying customer, with the price of life and limb no object in the pursuit of bold cooking.</p>

            <p>All gourmets have adventurous appetites. Those who chase the taste of aberrant cuisine push the palate farther than even most of their peers can stomach. They are fascinated by the possibilities of strange or otherworldly foods that rarely find their way onto the Prime Material Plane. These cooks are often obsessive about recording the details of their dives into the unknown, though such recipes are unlikely to be written in a legible hand, or to be recognized as edible at all. Many gourmets of this persuasion exude an unsettling, invasive air. A steady diet of foodstuffs outside of mortal comprehension can wreak bizarre changes to the tastebuds ... and the mind.</p>

            <p>The power to please, and therefore to manipulate, is a tempting reward for the years of work required to learn any fine craft. Some gourmets are attracted to the vocation for just such opportunities. They use their culinary skills to practice a kind of black magic, constructing alluring feasts and blending potions of ill intent. Practitioners know that the flesh of the conniving fey is the secret ingredient of many double-edged delights. They also emulate the tricky nature of such creatures: drawing in, pampering, and deceiving their patrons with the subtle spice of sylvan magic... always ready to turn on them the moment an irresistible advantage presents itself.</p>

            <p>Trained in exclusive dining clubs or renowned restaurants, practitioners of this cuisine exude confidence in their cooking ability and use it as a form of expressing their affluence. And nothing is as tellingly rich as dragon meat. Meals crafted with such rarefied ingredients are known to light a fire in the belly and leave a delightful aftertaste that can linger on the tongue for hours. Some consider these individuals snobbish, but like all gourmets, they carry a deep love of excellent cooking. Dragon scales and fangs are hunted by many for their rumoured mystical and medicinal properties -- but the gourmet knows that the true value of such a trophy must be brought out in the skillet.</p>

                <p>By 10th level, your draconic diet has nurtured magic in your blood that you can use to rebalance a situation moving out of your control. When a creature that retains temporary hit points from one of your gourmet features is within 60 feet of you and rolls a 1 on an attack roll or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend an ingredient die and imbue it with a sudden wealth of energy. Translucent, colored scales bloom on its body, granting it a +2 bonus to AC until the end of its next turn. The next attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn is automatically a 20.</p>

            <p>Some societies, including the tribes of the cold-minded Lizardmen, have normalized the appetites of cannibalism: the practice of eating others of your own kind. These cultures are few and far-between -- most civilizations agree it is one of the ultimate taboos. In the wilderness, however, the desperate can discover that they have the stomach for anything, if they might only survive. Individuals with a talent for cooking can become grim gourmets indeed under the threat of starvation.</p>
            <p class="indent">Others pursue this craft purposefully, as the butchers and blood-ministers of cults or communities dedicated to wicked gods. Whatever the path taken - neutral, regrettable, or reprehensible - the genuine skill of a true cannibal gourmet must be acknowledged. Without formal learning (for such records are routinely burned), they can create unsettingly mouth-watering recipes that offer new life out of death.</p>

            <p>Gourmets of this persuasion have been inspired by the way that the ingredients of the universe can be broken down into their most basic parts and endlessly recombined into new recipes. Experimenters and inventors at heart, they have an affinity for the study and manipulation of the elements, the very building blocks of all flavor, matter, and power, that elevates their molecular gastronomy to a method not unlike alchemy. With an accompaniment of arcane magic, these curious cooks create burning spices, silky-smooth sauces, air-light pastries, and deep textures unlike any other. When called to action as part of an adventuring band, they can use these lessons in fusion to enhance the effects of their spellwork, as well.</p>

                <p>When you choose this specialty at 2nd level, you enhance your cooking and combat skill with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn three cantrips: <i>produce flame</i> and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Elemental Cuisine Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</i></b> You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the conjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Elemental Cuisine Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a conjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a conjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you apply your learning through the medium of your cooking. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

            <p>Delectable jellied desserts are a classic of the kitchen; demon-spawned gelatinous killers, a classic of the dungeon. To see the two combined in the imagination of a gourmet was inevitable. Some chefs seeking their signature style will discover it on the walls of the dank, deep crawls their travels take them to, and set their mind to alchemizing their own sweet and sour oddities in the dessert mold. Gourmets gifted with the tastebuds to withstand the acidic burn of these ingredients can concoct incredible, technically-edible, wobbling wonders just oozing with flavor. Their own biology may, regrettably, lose its cohesion along the way.</p>

                <p>Starting from 6th level, you can use your cook’s utensils to create living jellies of your own. During a short or long rest, you can expend ingredient dice to create a pool of hit points using the same method as your Campfire Cook feature. From this pool, you create a number of sickly trifles in unoccupied spaces on horizontal or vertical surfaces within 5 feet of you. See this creature’s game statistics in the sickly trifle stat block. A trifle dissolves into nothing if it is reduced to 0 hit points, and cannot be harvested using your Stock Up feature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you use your Campfire Cook feature, you can also create sickly trifles by converting at least 4 temporary hit points from your meal into hit points for each trifle.</p>
                <p class="indent">The trifles last until your next long rest. You can create and control as many at once as you like, up to a maximum equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of one).</p>
                <p class="indent">When you create a trifle, you determine its color and appearance, within the bounds of its vague gelatinous form.</p>
                <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to command the trifles to take their Slather action if you are within 60 feet of them. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the trifles to move up to their speed. If you don’t issue any commands to them, your trifles will not move or take actions. A trifle can comfortably ride upon your person until commanded to move under its own power.</p>

                    <li>Once per short rest, you can become transparent for 1 minute. While transparent, even when in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot you if you have neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter your space while unaware of you is surprised by you. You must concentrate on the transformation as if concentrating on a spell.</li>

                <p>At 14th level, you can truthfully boast of breaking the mold with your caustic culinary inventions. As an action, you can expend an ingredient die to create a gelatinous cube. The cube swells into being around you, and you are Engulfed by the cube at the centre of its space. The cube uses its statblock from the Monster Manual, with the following changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cube has extra hit points equal to the number rolled on your expended ingredient die + your gourmet level. Any sickly trifles within 10 feet of you when the cube is created are absorbed into its mass, and their remaining hit points are also added to the cubes total hit points.</li>
                    <li>The DC of the Dexterity and Strength checks to avoid the cube’s Engulf action, or to pull a creature from the cube, now equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</li>
                    <li>While you are Engulfed by the cube, you are not restrained, and can freely enter or exit, treating the cubes space as difficult terrain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">The cube is friendly to you, and will obey your mental commands (no action required by you). In combat, the cube shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately before yours.</p>
                <p class="indent">At any time whilst the cube is within 5 feet of you, you can use an action to break the cube down into a number of sickly trifles up to your Wisdom modifier, allocating each trifle hit points as usual from the cube’s remaining hit point total.</p>
                <p class="indent">If it is reduced to 0 hit points, or is still intact after 1 hour, the cube dissolves into a puddle of ooze. Its remains cannot be harvested using your Stock Up feature.</p>

            <p>Deep in the guts of the great cities, thousands toil daily for a pittance. Unlike their wealthy employers, these hungry masses cannot rely on the luxuries of dining out, or personal cooks. Enterprising chefs, working with artificers and engineers, have risen to the occasion by automating the work of the kitchen as a means to offer a cheap, mass-produced selection of meals catering to beleaguered laborers.</p>
            <p class="indent">For a true gourmet, however, supervising such marvels is never enough. Many choose to leave the repetitive recipes in the hands of their advanced kitchens, and strike out once more in search of new novelties to add to their menus.</p>
            <p class="indent">A gourmet trained in the magical technologies necessary for industrial-scale catering can complement their cooking prowess with a variety of forward-thinking utensils. The most versatile - and, some might say, endearing - of these is no doubt the humble oven golem: a clay assistant fueled with a facsimile of life in aid of creating quick, quality food.</p>

                <p>By 2nd level, you have built a mobile means of automating your cooking, an oven golem. It is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the oven golem stat block. You determine the creature’s appearance and whether it has two legs or more; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.</p>
                <p class="indent">In combat, the oven golem shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or the Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action.</p>
                <p class="indent">The oven golem uses ingredient dice to fuel a number of special abilities, described in its stat block below. As an action, you can store a number of ingredient dice within the golem up to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. The oven golem requires at least one ingredient die to keep its internal fires kindling: if the last ingredient die stored within it is expended, it will immediately become inert. While inert, the oven golem is incapacitated, cannot move, and fails all saving throws. It remains in this state until you use an action to restock it with at least one ingredient die.</p>
                <p class="indent">If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it reaches 0 hit points and dies, you can recover ingredient dice stored within it so long as its body remains intact.</p>
                <p class="indent">At the end of a short rest, you can create a new oven golem if you have your potter’s tools with you. If you already have an oven golem from this feature, the first one immediately perishes.</p>

            <p>Many chefs, be it out of fond nostalgia, some misplaced samurai affect, or simply for good marketing, claim a signature tool of their trade. Gourmets are subject to the same habits, but for them a trusted utensil can mean much more than it would in an ordinary kitchen.</p>
            <p class="indent">On the road, items that prove useful in varied scrapes are highly valued. Perhaps your favored utensil is also your go-to weapon when a fight breaks out - or perhaps it was a gift that reminds you of home when the lights are few and the nights are long. Consider tying your favored utensil to your gourmet’s culinary speciality, and think about what instinct drives them to reach for it first.</p>

            <p>Locked in the mind as surely as it was once savored on the tongue, a sense memory of some emotionally charged dish is what many gourmets return to, time after time, meal after meal: the bedrock of their passion in the craft.</p>
            <p class="indent">A sense memory might be visual, aromatic, even aural, but it almost always refers back to some pivotal moment in a gourmets life that connects their soul with food. The meal that was served at the moment of this memory may not have even been very good. What matters is a powerful sense of nostalgia, excitement, or perhaps even trauma that it carries.</p>

            <p>A cook’s hours are long; an adventuring gourmet’s are no better, and the beds are often worse. Who can be blamed for a little indulgence at the end of the day?</p>
            <p class="indent">If your gourmet has a penchant for sneaking secret treats, consider the severity, and the cost, of the habit. Sugar is a vice all too easily found in a kitchen, but it could be hard to come by on the open road. Is your indulgence a source of satisfaction, or shame? Perhaps your preferred relaxation food reflects poorly on your tastes among judgmental contemporaries. How your character considers their own indulgences can say a lot about them to others.</p>
