        <description>
            <p>Witches are usually (but not always) women that specialize in ancient natural magic to heal, charm, or harm their enemies and allies alike. Using their superior intellect and calling on a Familiar to assist them, they are capable of astonishing feats of magical prowess.</p>
            <p class="indent">While Witches have a reputation for being cruel and evil, many of them are quiet, benign, and helpful to those around them. In either case, they tend to be shunned by polite society because of their unusual connection to nature and the magic within.</p>
            <p class="indent">Most witches will learn from an older, more experienced witch, often in a secluded part of nature where their unorthodox casting methods will go unnoticed. However, some witches learn on their own through careful study.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A WITCH</h4>
            <p>When creating your Witch, consider how you acquired your power. Were you instructed by another witch? Or maybe you discovered your power through careful study and evaluation. Perhaps you discovered a long-lost tome that gave you the basics of natural magic. Or you could have a natural talent for bending the forces of nature to your will.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can build a Witch quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Outlander background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an witch, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d6 per witch level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per witch level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled mb">

            <ul>
                <li>(a) a quarterstaff, or (b) a dagger</li>
                <li>(a) a component pouch or (b) a spellcasting focus</li>
                <li>(a) a Dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an Explorer’s Pack</li>
            </ul>

                <p>See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the witch spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Witch spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Fog Cloud and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Fog Cloud using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to interpret and coerce the forces of nature. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your witch spells.</p>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast a Witch spell that you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>

                <h5>Coven Spells</h5>
                <p>Each Coven has a list of spells - Coven Spells - that you gain at the Witch levels noted in the Coven description. Once you gain a Coven spell, you always know it, and it doesn’t count against your total number of spells known.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you have a Coven spell that doesn’t appear on the Witch spell list, the spell is nonetheless a Witch spell for you.</p>

If you are killed, your soul will latch on to the closest inanimate object currently being worn or carried by another creature. You may remain in the object or depart for the afterlife. While locked to this item, you imbue it with power. The item becomes magical if it isn’t already, allowing its wielder access to the Craft Magic you knew before death. You may also telepathically speak to the user. This communication cannot be stopped in any way. You may return to life by possessing the corpse of a creature that has been dead no longer than a week and is of the same size as your previous body. You lose your previous racial features and gain those of the new body. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. You take a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time you finish a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. Each time you use this feature, the penalty increases by two. When you reach a total penalty of -12, you can no longer benefit from this feature. For every month you go without using this feature, the total penalty is reduced by one, to a minimum of -4.</p>
