            <p>She disappears into the shadows, startling the guard who had just caught sight of her. Reappearing behind him, the gnome's blade flashes as he dies, turning into ash as he falls. She turns away before he does so, not even bothering to stay and witness his disappearance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hidden in a small room, a half-elf looks around, the heart in his hand whispering the secrets of people only he can see. Opening the door a crack, he creates an illusion, perfectly crafted to be everything the person in the next room desires. While they stare at it, mesmerized, he leaves unseen.</p>
            <p class="indent">Lurking through the shadows at the base of the tower, the dwarf spies around a corner and pulls back, barely avoiding the gaze of an approaching patrol. They enter the alleyway and continue on, seeing nothing more suspicious than a slightly darker shadow hidden behind an abandoned cart.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever their gift, voidtouched prefer to stay out of the limelight, harnessing the energy of the Outer Planes granted to them by a mysterious entity. Whether it expresses itself as a weapon made of darkness or the speaking heart of a dead loved one, these occasionally disturbing objects are a tangible connection sometimes disapproved of by rather a lot of people.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A VOIDTOUCHED</h4>
            <p>As you make your voidtouched character, think about what attracted your benefactor's attention. Were you betrayed and abandoned, turning to whichever help you could get? Did you live a tumultuous life, catching their attention? Or did you worship them, asking to be granted a boon?</p>
            <p class="indent">What do you plan to do now? Do you want to take revenge for whatever was done to you? Are you planning to gain riches beyond measures using your new abilities? Or do you just want to live in peace, if only the world would let you?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a voidtouched character quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Charisma. Second, choose the criminal background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <description>
                <p>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>Archery</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>Blind Fighting</h5>
                <p>Being unable to see a creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it, provided the creature isn’t hidden from you.</p>
                <h5>Close Quarters Shooter</h5>
                <p>You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>Dueling</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>Thrown Weapon Fighting</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                <h5>Two-Weapon Fighting</h5>
                <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
                <h5>Unarmed Fighting</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.</p>

            <description>
                <p>You have been granted supernatural vision to detect living beings around you. As an action, you can see a faint aura around any creature within 30 feet of you as long as it is not invisible, undead, or a construct. You know its general shape but neither the type nor the identity of those you see in this way. This feature can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt, though it still shows creatures wearing armor as long as they aren't fully encased in metal. You also gain Darkvision up to 30 feet, if you do not already have it.</p>
                <p class="indent">This feature lasts for 1 minute or until you lose concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach 11th level, this feature isn't blocked by physical objects anymore and allows you to see invisible creatures.</p>

The target must make a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a success, the target is unaffected and knows you attempted to possess it. On a failure, your body disappears and the creature is possessed by you.</p>
                <p class="indent">While possessing a creature, you retain your mental abilities but otherwise use your target's physical stats including AC, damage and condition vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities, and hit points. You do not gain access to its knowledge, memories, abilities, or proficiencies. You cannot cast any spells while possessing a creature. You can take actions while possessing a creature, though you cannot take the Attack action.</p>
                <p class="indent">The possession ends after 1 minute, if you choose to end it as a bonus action, if the creature is targeted by remove curse, dispel magic, or similar magic, or if the creature is reduced to 0 hit points. After the possession ends, you regain the hit points you had before the possession and are placed in a random spot within 5 feet of the creature. If this is the result of a spell ending it or the creature being reduced to 0 hit points, you fall prone. If any damage remains after the possessed creature is reduced to 0 hit points, you take this damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">Other creatures may discover your possession with a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check.</p>
