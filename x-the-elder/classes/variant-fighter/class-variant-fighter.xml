        <description>
            <p>The Variant Fighter by Vorpal Dice Press acts as a bridge for groups who love the flavorful combat options of battlemaster maneuvers but don’t want to always be a battlemaster on every character they play. Presented here are a variety of battlemaster maneuvers, and new maneuvers, reformatted and balanced to work as a base class feature for the Fighter class.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition to these base class maneuvers, there are subclass specific maneuvers for many fighter archetypes, and a Tactician subclass to replace the lost Battlemaster.</p>
            <p class="indent">For those worried that this adds too much power to the Fighter without taking anything away, check out the Fighting Maneuvers document at DriveThruRPG to see a variant I created later to address these concerns.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt a spellcasting martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a fighter, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per fighter level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per class level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
