        <description>
            <p>The halfling thief looks around as an ogre finds its hiding spot. As the ogre slams its club down, a swordsman appears with a flash of blue light to block the club with his glowing sword. Between him and his halfling friend, they easily dispatch the surprised ogre.</p>
            <p class="indent">The mighty dragon breathes fire at the intruder, but the lightly armored elf smiles unconcerned. She strides through the fire, a redish, magical barrier protecting her from the worst of the flames. The shocked dragon has little time to react to the impossibly alive elf before her blade starts cutting through the dragon's scales.</p>
            <p class="indent">As the bandit's blade threatens to cut the pale warrior in half, the warrior simply twists his hand and mutters an arcane word of power. The bandit cries out in pain as his sword arm suddenly stops in place. With a chilling smile, the warrior plunges his blade into the bandit savoring the warmth of vitality gained from the bandit's blood.</p>
            <p class="indent">All these magical warriors are swordmages, combatants that blend magic and martial might. Regardless of a swordmage's magical specialization, magic is crucial to a swordmage. Unlike more mundane warriors, swordmages rely on magic to boost their defensive and offensive capabilities.</p>
            <h4>IT'S ALL ABDimOUT THE BLADE</h4>
            <p>Swordmages spend as much time learning magic as they do practicing their bladework. The synthesis of these dual studies is represented by a swordmage's weapon, which through magical bonding becomes the conduit of a swordmage's magic. As a wizard records their spell knowledge in a spellbook, a swordmage inscribes their magical knowledge as glyphs onto their bonded weapon. Since a swordmage's bonded weapon is not only their tool in combat, but also their source of magic, swordmages treat this weapon with the utmost care. Although the name implies sword wielders, some swordmages choose other weapons such as axes, spears, or flails.</p>
            <h4>TIMELESS TRADITION</h4>
            <p>Some say the swordmage tradition started with the elves who once sought to create guardians against a forgotten darkness. Others speak of the magical warriors of fearsome githyanki that terrorize the Astral Sea. Regardless of the tradition's origins, the path of the swordmage entices those ambitious enough to focus on two opposing arts: swordplay and magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">As the swordmage tradition has grown in popularity, many beyond elves and githyanki have chosen this ambitious practice. Some swordmages were once simple warriors that after witnessing the wonders of devastation of the arcane, then decided to incorporate magic into their fighting style. Other swordmages were once apprentice mages that after a formative event, then realized magic was not enough to survive and achieve their ambitions. Either way, a swordmage requires a dedicated mind and body. One must seek new knowledge but also practice martial excellence.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</h4>
            <p>As you build your swordmage, carefully consider two elements of your character's background: Where were they trained and what weapon will they bond with? Some large cities, especially among more magical cultures such as the elves, might have institutions that train aspiring swordmages. Perhaps you were a trained soldier chosen for your intelligence to learn magic in order to help your cause win a war. Maybe you apprenticed with a swordmage mentor who taught you all they knew and you are now striking out on your own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Furthermore, how does your swordmage fight? The weapon you bond with is an important choice. Was the weapon a family heirloom or perhaps passed down from the master that taught you everything you know? Or did you earn this weapon in combat and it represents your first victory?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a swordmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, your highest ability score should be Dexterity or Strength, depending on whether you want to focus on regular melee weapons or on finesse melee weapons. Your next-highest score should be Intelligence as this determines the power of your magic. Second, choose the soldier or scholar background.</p>

            <h3>MULTICLASSING</h3>
            <p>When you advance in level, and with your DM's permission, you may take the option to multiclass into a swordmage. You must meet the following prerequisites to qualify for a swordmage.</p>
            <h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>
            <p>You need a 13 Intelligence, and a 13 Strength or 13 Dexterity.</p>
            <h4>PROFICIENCIES</h4>
            <p>When you first multiclass into swordmage, you gain only proficiency in simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, and medium armor.</p>
            <h4>SPELL SLOTS</h4>
            <p>When determining spell slots, you add one half (rounded up) of your swordmage levels to the levels of your other classes as described on page 164 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. Use the resulting total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table on page 165 of the <i>Player's Handbook</i>.</p>
            <h3>OPTIONAL CLASS FEATURES</h3>
            <p>This section offers additional features that you can gain as a swordmage. Unlike the earlier features, you don't gain the features here automatically. Consulting with your DM, you decide whether to gain a feature in this section if you meet the level requirement noted in the feature's description. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use one, both, or none of them.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, you learn a ritual that magically transforms one weapon into your magical conduit. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and transform it into your Arcane Weapon. The chosen weapon becomes your spellcasting focus for your swordmage spells.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If your Arcane Weapon is within a mile of you, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</li>
                    <li>If your Arcane Weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour to magically repair the weapon.</li>
                    <li>If your Arcane Weapon lacks the two-handed property, and you are wielding it in one hand with another hand free, then you gain a magical +1 bonus to your AC.

                <h5>WEAPON REQUIRED</h5>

                <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the swordmage spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional swordmage cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the swordmage table.</p>

                <p>The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your swordmage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these swordmage spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the swordmage spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Swordmage table shows when you learn more swordmage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the swordmage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the swordmage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your swordmage spells, since your magic reflects your arcane studies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use your Arcane Weapon as your spellcasting focus for swordmage spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">See chapter 10 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>

                <p>Most swordmages prioritize certain types of magic and choosing your tradition reflects your arcane preferences and possible schooling. You fully specialize when you reach 3rd level, and the power you gain represents the culmination of all of your training.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you reach 3rd level, you choose a tradition that reflects your magical specialization. The details on the specific traditions are at the end of this document.</p>

                <p>Each swordmage tradition has a list of additional spells that you automatically learn at the denoted levels. The spells counts as Swordmage spells for you, but do not count against the number of Swordmage spells you know.</p>
                <h5>AEGIS</h5>
                <p>Your swordmage tradition gives you a powerful dweomer called an Aegis. Each Aegis provided by your tradition explains how to use it. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Aegis again.</p>
                <p class="indent">The saving throw DC for your Aegis effects is equal to your swordmage spell save DC.</p>
                <p class="indent">Beginning at 10th level, you can use your Aegis twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>

                <p>At 7th level, you have delved deeper into esoteric studies and have learned to cast spells as rituals. You gain a ritual book, which contains the spells you can cast as a ritual as long as you have the book on hand. Your ritual book starts off with two 1st level spells and one 2nd level spell with the ritual tag from the wizard class. If you already have a ritual book, you can add those spells to your book.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical scroll or a wizard's spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the wizard's spell list, the spell's level must be of a level you can cast, and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual books takes 2 hours per level of the spells, and costs 50 gp per level of the spell. This cost represents material components spent on practicing the spell, as well as the fine inks you must use to record it.</p>

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, and you sap their life force. You gain 1d4 temporary hit points. The temporary hit points disappear at the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 5th level, the attack deals extra necrotic damage to the target equal to 1d8 for a melee weapon or 1d6 for a ranged weapon, and increases to 2d8 or 2d6 at 11th level, and 3d8 or 3d6 at 17th level. Also, the temporary hit points gained increases to 1d6 at 5th level, 1d8 at 11th level, and 1d10 at 17th level.</p>

                <p>You interrupt a creature's attack by warping space with your blade, causing your foe to appear a short distance away and unleash its attack elsewhere. The creature must succeed a Wisdom saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away from their original location. That space must be on the ground or on a floor. The creature then makes their attack against another creature of your choosing within range. If there is no creature within range, the attack is expended.</p>
