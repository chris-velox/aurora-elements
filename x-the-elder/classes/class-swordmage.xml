        <description>
            <p>The halfling thief looks around as an ogre finds its hiding spot. As the ogre slams its club down, a swordsman appears with a flash of blue light to block the club with his glowing sword. Between him and his halfling friend, they easily dispatch the suprised ogre.</p>
            <p class="indent">The mighty dragon breathes fire at the intruder, but the lightly armored elf smiles unconcerned. She strides through the fire, a redish, magical barrier protecting her from the worst of the flames. The shocked dragon has little time to react to the impossibly alive elf before her twin blades start cutting through its scales.</p>
            <p class="indent">As the bandit’s blade threatens to cut the pale warrior in half, the warrior simply twists his hand and mutters an arcane word of power. The bandit cries out in pain as his sword arm suddenly stops in place. With a chilling smile, the warrior plunges his blade into the bandit savoring the warmth of vitality gained from the bandit’s blood.</p>
            <p class="indent">All these magical warriors are swordmages, combatants that blend magic and martial might. Whether a swordmage relies on necromancy, elemental manipulation, abjuration, or many other types of magic. Regardless of a swordmage’s magical specialization, magic is crucial to a swordmage. Unlike more mundane warriors, swordmages rely on magic to boost their defensive and offensive capabilities.</p>
            <h4>MAGICAL WARRIORS</h4>
            <p>Swordmages spend equal time learning magic as they do practicing their bladework creating an unique fighting style. Although all swordmages rely on defensive and offensive magic, they often specialize in certain types of magic similiarly to a wizard. Crimson Knights focus on the application of necromantic blood magic while Inquisitors specialize on abjuration and divination magic to hunt down supernatural threats.</p>
            <h4>BONDING TO A WEAPON</h4>
            <p>Besides magic, swordmages also bond with a particular weapon to provide a conduit for their arcane prowess. As their bonded weapon is not only their tool in combat, but also a source of magic, swordmages normally treat their weapon with the the utmost care. Choosing your bonded weapon is an important step that is often dictated by their weapon training or personal style. Although the name implies sword wielders, some swordmages choose other weapons such as axes, spears, or flails.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</h4>
            <p>As you build your swordmage, carefully consider three elements of your character’s background: Where were they trained, what magic interests them the most, and what weapon will they bond with? Some large cities, especially among more magical cultures such as the elves, might have institutions that train aspiring swordmages. Perhaps you were a trained soldier chosen for your intelligence to learn magic to help your cause win a war. Maybe you apprenticed with a swordmage mentor who taught you all they knew and now you are striking out on your own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Furthermore, how does your swordmage fight? With dual blades or a large greatsword meant to intimidate your enemies? The weapon or weapons you bond with is an important choice. Was the weapon a family heirloom or perhaps passed down from the master that taught you everything you know? Or did you earn this weapon in combat and it represents your first victory?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a swordmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, your highest ability score should be Dexterity or Strength, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on finesse weapons. Your next-highest score should be Intelligence as this determines the power of your magic. Second, choose the soldier or scholar background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

            <h3>MULTICLASSING</h3>
            <p>When you advance in level, and at your DM’s discretion, you may take the option to multiclass into a swordmage. You must meet the following prerequisites to qualify for an swordmage.</p>
            <h4>PREREQUISITES</h4>
            <p>You need a 13 Intelligence, and a 13 Strength or 13 Dexterity.</p>
            <h4>PROFICIENCIES</h4>
            <p>When you first multiclass into swordmage, you gain only proficiency in simple weapons, martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields.</p>
            <h4>SPELL SLOTS</h4>
            <p>When determining spell slots, you add one half (rounded down) of your swordmage levels to the levels of your other classes as described on page 164 of the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>. Use the resulting total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table on page 165 of the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, you learn a ritual that magically binds a weapon to yourself. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and transform it into your Arcane Weapon. Your Arcane Weapon can be used as a spellcasting focus for your Swordmage spells.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 1st level, you have learned a handful of spells to augment your fighting style. You learn two cantrips from the swordmage spell list. See Spells Rules in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em> for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the swordmage spell list at the end of this document.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your swordmage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these swordmage spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the swordmage spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Swordmage table shows when you learn more swordmage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the swordmage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the swordmage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your swordmage spells, since your magic reflects yoour arcane studies. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</li>

            <p>Elementalist are swordmages that specialize in magic originating from the elemental planes. By binding the primal power of the planes to themselves, these swordmages become mortal embodiments of the elements. They might show minor physical manifestations of this power such as earthen skin, an ozone smell, or greenish skin.</p>

                <p>Starting at 3rd level, you have delved deeper into the esoteric studies of magic. You acquire a ritual book holding one 1st level spell with the ritual tag from the wizard class.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical scroll or a wizard’s spellbook, you might be able to add it to your ritual book. The spell must be on the wizard’s spell list, the spell’s level must be of a level you can cast, and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual books takes 2 hours per level of the spells, and costs 50 gp per level of the spell. This cost represents material components spent on practicing the spell, as well as the fine inks you must use to record it.</p>

            <p>The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, your weapon darkens with necrotic power, and the attack deals an extra 4d8 necrotic damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be wounded for the spell’s duration. While wounded, hit points lost to this spell can be regained only through a Short or Long Rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.</p>
            <p class="indent">At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one.</p>

            <p>You interrupt a creature’s attack by warping space with your blade, causing your foe to appear a short distance away and unleash its attack elsewhere. The creature must succeed a Charisma saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space up to 60 feet away from their original location. That space must be on the ground or on a floor. The creature then makes their attack against another creature of your choosing within range. If there is no creature within range, the attack is expended.</p>

            <p>You hurl your blade and it transforms into a line of roaring fire 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a creature within range. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. You then teleport to an unoccupied square within 5 feet of the target. The roaring flames transform back into your weapon and returns to your hand. You can then make one melee weapon attack against the target. On a hit, you deal an extra 4d8 fire damage.</p>
