        <description>
            <p>Robes stained with countless blemishes, a plump gnome trundles toward the enfeebled winged serpent before her. Thin transparent lines of arcane force extend from her fingers as claws, and she rakes them across its form. The radiant creature crumples into the dirt. Well-worn knife in hand, she sets to work. Before too long, she emerges with her prize: the eye of the beast. A hint of saliva escapes her lips as she fastidiously prepares the morsel. Her large eyes glow with a dull light as she chews, savoring the taste.</p>
            <p class="indent">Placing an indigo hand on his companion’s shoulder, a tiefling in well-oiled leathers recites a barely audible chant under his breath. His words guide his focus as he weaves together fine threads of magic that bind he and his companion together. A small sigh of relief, and the two separate. The tiefling casts a spell, and as gills and webbing appear across his form, the same effect takes hold across his companion’s body. They turn to the murky depths before them, and dive into the unknown.</p>
            <p class="indent">Magicians are magic-users defined by physicality and embodied knowledge, united in their disciplined exercise of the flows of magic in the world. Eschewing a reliance on texts and materials in favor of what "works," magicians may have the appearance of fighters more than spellcasters, yet differ from most fighters by relying on piercing intellect and arcane knowhow to augment their physical abilities and gain the upper hand over their foes. Trained according to hard living and tending toward nomadic existences, their magic is a tool for survival first and foremost. No dusty hermits, magicians trade lives of solitary study for practical examinations of the ebbs of flows of magic all around them.</p>

You know the location of magic, or any celestial, elemental, fey or fiend within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. On your next turn you can use your action see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>BLIND FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Being unable to see a creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it, provided the creature isn’t hidden from you</p>
                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>
                <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
                <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Unarmed Fighting Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.</p>

            <description>
                <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned how to harness the magic inherent to the nature of the multiverse to cast spells, much as a wizard does. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and Appendix A of this document for the magician spell list. Appendix B details a number of spells exclusive to this class.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The magician table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the magician spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Magician table shows when you learn more magician spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the magician spells you know and replace it with another spell from the magician spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your magician spells, since your magic draws from your intellect and memorization of the laws of the multiverse. You use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a magician spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

            <description>
                <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you learn how to enhance your weapon strikes with arcane might. You gain a pool of d6s that you can spend to augment your weapon attacks. On a hit with a weapon attack, you can spend a number of dice up to your Intelligence modifier, rolling the dice you spend and adding their total to the damage dealt by the attack. The maximum number of dice in the pool equals your magician level. The size of the dice in the pool increases as you gain magician levels, as shown on the Low Magic column of the Magician Table.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, as a bonus action you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of low magic dice equal to the slot’s level. You can never gain more low magic dice than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent low magic dice when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you gain this feature, choose one type of damage: bludgeoning, force, necrotic, piercing, psychic, or slashing. The additional damage from your low magic always deals magical damage of this type. When you reach 6th and 14th level you can select an additional damage type, choosing which type to use whenever you activate this feature.</p>

            <p>The gourmand knows that the stomach always knows. Sometimes gluttonous, sometimes picky eaters, these magicians develop their abilities by consuming the magic of others. Potentially prone to eccentricity, or even shunned from public life due to their gustatory proclivities, gourmands may dedicate themselves to sharing their skills for the joy of others, or become selfish consumers atop a mountain of stolen flesh. All gourmands pride themselves on their culinary skills, and can manage to distill the essence of the foes they fell into meals that enhance their abilities and allow them to channel extraordinary magics.</p>

                <p>When you dedicate yourself to this practice at 3rd level, you learn how to harvest, prepare, and eat pieces of your foes to gain benefits.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Harvest:</b> If you spend 1 minute working, you can attempt to harvest an organ, piece of flesh, or other morsel associated with the abilities of a deceased creature within your reach. To do so, make an Intelligence check adding your proficiency bonus. The DC of this check equals 10 + the CR of the creature you are attempting to harvest. On a success, you obtain one meal’s worth of ingredients from the creature. A creature may only be subject to the Harvest ability once, as a success removes whatever usable ingredients the creature holds and a failure destroys those ingredients. If you have previously harvested from the same type of creature as your current target, you have advantage on attempts to harvest ingredients from the target.</p>
                <p class="indent">Certain creatures may not hold any usable ingredients, may not leave a boody when killed, or may not be magical, as determined by the DM. Some creatures may be able to willingly provide you with ingredients, as determined by the DM.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>Feast:</b> During the course of a short or long rest, you can prepare and consume a previously harvested ingredient of your choice. When you do so, one spell the creature could cast becomes a magician spell for you and you gain the ability to cast that spell in the manner in which the creature could have cast it, without expending a spell slot. You may learn a spell of a level no higher than one half your level in this class, rounded up.</p>
                <p class="indent">If the creature could use a special action, such as Multiattack or a Red Dragon's Fire Breath, you can choose to gain use of that action instead of learning a spell. When you use that action, you manifest an aura of magical energy to replicate any actions taken with limbs you do not possess. You use your Intelligence modifier for attack and damage rolls, as well as save DCs, for actions taken using this feature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Abilities gained in this way are lost when you use them, when you prepare and consume a new ingredient, or when you take a long rest. Others may share in meals prepared using this feature for sustenance, but do not gain any special benefits from it unless they have the Food Magic feature.</p>

To the shade, the creature who lives longest typically knows the most, or uses what they know the best. Shades may find a variety of reasons to join in the pursuits of others, particularly when they might hope to unearth hidden or forbidden knowledge, but can tend toward a jealous possessiveness when threatened.</p>

On a hit, the target suffers the attack's normal effects, as well as the effects of the spell. On a miss, the spell also fails.

            <p>Weavers study the fine fabric of magic in the world, learning how to shift and manipulate those weaves toward their advantage. Weavers rarely live solitary existences, instead affirming a simple truth: knowledge is social. Sharing their magics and their gifts widely, Weavers tend toward supportive and helpful personalities, or may find themselves the center of a legion of devoted followers.</p>

                <p>When you dedicate yourself to this practice at 3rd level, you gain the ability to magically bind yourself to others, sharing beneficial effects. When you take a long or short rest, you can spend an hour leading one willing creature in meditation. While that creature is within 30 feet of you, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target that creature. Creatures do not need to remain within 30 feet of you to retain the effects of the spell, though they lose the effects of the spell when the spell ends.</p>

When that object is used to deal damage to a creature of the specified type, that creature must make a Constitution save or become vulnerable to damage dealt by that object for the duration of the spell. If you touch an object capable of creating an effect that forces a target to make a saving throw or take damage, such as a spell component, this effect applies on failure of that saving throw, rather than requiring an additional saving throw.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the Duration is Concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the Duration is 8 hours. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a Duration that doesn't require Concentration.</p>

                <p>You twist a creature’s mental capacities, forcing a creature in range to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the target cannot speak up to 10 words of your choice for the duration. The words can be a specific phrase, a list of 10 unrelated words, or a mix of both. The spell interferes with any attempt to communicate the words, such as speaking, writing, or drawing.

                <p>Choose two 10 ft. radius circles on the ground at points you can see within range. The terrain at each location, as well as all creatures and objects touching it, instantaneously switch locations. This spell fails if either circle would include an object or creature that cannot fit inside its radius. For purposes of this spell, floors, such as worked stone, are not considered objects.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of each circle increases by 5 feet for each level above 3rd.</p>
