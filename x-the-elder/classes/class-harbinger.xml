        <description>
            <p>A man walks out of an inferno, nary a scratch on his form, as those who challenged him burn to ashes.</p>
            <p class="indent">A decrepid, thin figure lays a finger on a soldier as he leaves, then watches the disease of his creation spread like wildfire.</p>
            <p class="indent">A goliath stands atop a mountaintop, commanding the snow and ice to punish wrongdoers below.</p>
            <h4>NATURE’S WRATH</h4>
            <p>Harbingers serve to remind everyone that while nature may be beautiful at times, one should never forget the sheer destructive power of its wrath and the devestation of its unbridled fury. Wielding powerful magic, harbingers manipulate these forces to annihilate their foes.</p>
            <h4>A SOLEMN DUTY</h4>
            <p>Harbingers know that all things must come to an end, even the highest of powers. Few relish in this realization, seeing their work as a necessary evil to keep the world in balance. Some harbingers break this mold, becoming deadly legends or powerful mage tyrants. Little can challenge the strength of a powerful harbinger with no reservations.</p>
            <h4>DESTRUCTIVE MAGIC</h4>
            <p>A harbinger’s magic is infused with the power of entropy from their defeated foes. This leads to much more destructive and deadly magic, and a harbinger who is not careful could easily end up destroying their allies and themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">This power comes at a cost, and some believe that it is slowly eating away at the souls of harbingers, turning them into monsters with a lack of any human empathy or compassion.</p>
            <h4>THE FINAL DEATH</h4>
            <p>Even though some druids may focus on more destructive magics, such as those of the Circle of Spores or the Circle of Wildfire, their magic still is with the aim of rebirth and renewal. Harbingers aim to destroy and for their destruction to stay that way.</p>
            <h4>FUELED BY ENTROPY</h4>
            <p>Harbinger’s magic comes directly from the forces of entropy. Death and destruction empower them and allow their magic to be more deadly and farther reaching, and this can very quickly snowball until a harbinger’s magic is more destructive than the fury of a god.</p>
            <p class="indent">This connection to entropy leads to a somewhat grim outlook on death in most harbingers, and little compassion for the dead.</p>
            <h4>DARK OMENS</h4>
            <p>Harbingers are usually feared and shunned in any civilized communities, as their mere prescense is often seen as a sign of great destruction. This is usually true, though moreso because the destruction often seen is as a direct result of the harbinger in question, and less because they are omens of the apocalypse. Nevertheless, this has led to them being known colloquially as harbingers, doombringers, or vanquishers.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever the case, the appearence of a harbinger is rarely a good sign for the surrounding area. If the inhabitants are lucky, the harbinger will leave sooner. If not, the area will soon be plagued by powerful and strange weather conditions.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A HARBINGER</h4>
            <p>When creating a harbinger, you should think about what causes their connection to nature. This connection isn’t quite like a druid’s. While druids focus more on the magic of life and birth (or rebirth in the case of more destructive druids, such as those of the Circle of Spores), the magic of harbingers is much more grim, focusing on entropy and death.</p>
            <p class="indent">This connection likely has a profound effect on your character’s psyche. For most harbingers, this either leaves the being afraid to use their power or completely morally bankrupt, slaughtering anything that gets in their way.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>One can quickly create a harbinger by following these steps. First, make Wisdom your highest ability score, followed by Strength. Second, pick the Haunted One background. Third, choose the fire bolt, shillelagh, druidcraft, and control flames cantrips.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

                <p>Drawing on the power of nature’s wrath, you can cast spells that bend this primal force to your bidding.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the harbinger spell list. You learn additional harbinger cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Harbinger table.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>The Harbinger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your harbinger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these harbinger spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of harbinger spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the harbinger spell list. When you do so, choose a number of harbinger spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your harbinger level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of harbinger spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your harbinger spells, since your magic draws from primal forces. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a harbinger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your harbinger spells.</p>

Creatures that fail their saving throw take 3d10 thunder damage and are pushed 15 feet away from you and knocked prone. Creatures that succeed their saving throw take half as much damage and don’t suffer any additional effects. Unsecured objects are thrown by the shock wave 15 feet past the end of the wave’s range. The shock wave is heard up to 1 mile away.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses on a long rest.</p>

                <p>You unleash a blast of sheer cold on the area around you. Creatures within range must make a Constitution saving throw or take 16d6 cold damage and their speed is reduced to 0 for one minute. In addition, creatures can only take an action or bonus action on each of their turns, not both. Creatures that succeed take half as much cold damage and don’t suffer any of the other effects of the spell.</p>

                <p>You infect a creature with a flesh-eating disease that bypasses immunity to disease. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, or it becomes infected. Every minute that passes, an infected creature will take 2d8 necrotic damage and loses 1 point of Constitution. A creature reduced to 0 Constitution from this feature is killed. This damage bypasses all resistance and immunity. Any creature that comes within 10 feet of an infected creature must make a Constitution saving throw or become infected.</p>

A creature that starts its turn within the hurricane moves 5 feet upwards through the cyclone, being ejeted from the top if they are at the top of the cyclone and being hurled away 3d8 x 10 feet in a random direction. A creature trapped inside may attempt to make a Strength saving throw to free itself, dropping out of the cyclone on a success and being hurled away 3d8 x 10 feet in a random direction.</p>

                <p>You create an opening in the ground that causes a fountain of magma erupt out onto the surrounding area and flow in a direction of your choosing. Choose a point within range where the magma erupts and the direction of the flow from that point. The lava flow fills area 75 feet long and 10 feet wide that can be in a straight line or a gentle curve. The lava is considered difficult terrain and remains until it cools down and hardens into rock after 1d12 hours. Creatures in the path of the lava flow when it is created or that enter the flow at any point before it cools down must make a Dexterity saving throw taking 12d6 fire damage or half as much on a successful one. Creatures within 15 feet of the eruption point must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage from the erupting magma. The eruption itself only lasts for 1 round.</p>
