        <description>
            <p>With a scripture in one hand and a longsword in the other, a human stands across a horde of undead. After a moment of contemplation on whether undead are able to think for themselves, he opens his book to read a passage, snaps it shut, and engulfs the horde with a display of fire and light. He decides he’ll consider their sentience on his own time.</p>
            <p class="indent">A half-elf perches on a branch, a grin on her face as she looks down on the forest below. She borrowed some spell scrolls without permission for her research, and now she was being hunted down. She hears someone shout as they trigger her crossbow trap. It was time to make her escape, the scrolls she had borrowed wouldn’t study themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">Surrounded by hundreds upon hundreds of dusty tomes, a dwarf considers several sources of magic. These sources are arcane, divine, and primal, which are fractured further into countless spells and methods to cast them. However, that isn’t enough for her. Her desire is the desire of every philosopher, to prove the theory that magic is the same regardless of the source. That is the essence of magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Philosophers pursue the essence of magic, drawing from as many sources of magic as they can manage and making them their own, which has granted them the ability to cast with a variety unrivaled by every other spellcaster. As part of this pursuit, they seek knowledge without exception, which causes them to be skilled in several fields, including martial combat. Not bound by common sense, they combine countless talents to achieve their aim.</p>
            <h4>UNIVERSAL GENIUS</h4>
            <p>The path of a philosopher could be compared to a wide plain instead of a narrow road. They wield spell, sword, and skill in equal measure, it would be difficult to find a field they aren’t competent in. However, the same could be said of a field they’re peerless in, the price paid by a philosopher for their breadth of knowledge is depth.</p>
            <p class="indent">A philosopher is starved for knowledge and wealth, adventuring can provide both. Because of that, it isn’t a surprise that several make the decision to become an adventurer. Whether they help the party as a guide or use them for their own purposes, they tend to succeed due to their ability to handle any situation that’d occur.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PHILOSOPHER</h4>
            <p>As you build your philosopher, think about your character’s background. Why did you choose to become a philosopher instead of picking a simpler path? How are you treated due to your choice, are you considered a genius or a fool? How do you use the knowledge that you’ve gathered? You could use it to help other people, or to fulfill your own ambition.</p>
            <p class="indent">You might have been born in a position of privilege and tutored by the best and brightest, or you might be a spiteful person that refuses to be considered mediocre. What are your views on art and beauty? You could consider them more important than magic, or dismiss them entirely. Regardless of who you are, live the way you want to live.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a philosopher quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma should be your highest ability scores, followed by Strength or Dexterity depending on the archetype that you decide to adopt. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose cleric and wizard for Theorycraft, along with the guidance, sacred flame, fire bolt, and ray of frost cantrips.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a philosopher, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>

        <description>
            <p>Your pursuit of the essence of magic has granted you the ability to cast a variety of spells. See chapter 10 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for spells.</p>
            <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
            <p>Choose two classes: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. You learn two cantrips of your choice from each class’s spell list. You can choose each class only once, and you can choose two additional classes at 5th and 9th level.</p>
            <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
            <p>The Philosopher table shows how many times you can cast your spells of 1st-level or higher. The table also shows the level the spells are cast at. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the spell lists of the classes you chose. To do so, choose one spell from each spell list. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Theorycraft Level column for your level.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you’re a 5th-level philosopher, you have four uses of this feature. If you chose bard, cleric, warlock, and wizard as your classes, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, one spell from each spell list. To cast the 1st-level spell bless, you must expend a use of this feature, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying how to cast each spell your own way: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>The lowest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spells from this class, since you learn your spells from several sources. You use the lowest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use the lowest of these modifiers when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + the lowest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + the lowest of your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifiers</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>You can use a book (found in chapter 5 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>) as a spellcasting focus for your spells from this feature.</p>

As an action, you can cast up to two different spells using your Theorycraft feature, only one of which can be a spell of 1st-level or higher (a cantrip is a spell). If you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, you expend a use of your Theorycraft feature as normal. The spells must have a casting time of 1 action or 1 bonus action, and they can be cast in any order.

When you set a trap, you can designate any number of creatures you know, which don’t trigger it. When a creature that is not behind total cover comes within 30 feet of the trap or ends its turn there, the trap is triggered to shoot it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or take piercing damage equal to the crossbow’s damage die + your Dexterity modifier. Once the trap is triggered or you end the effect (no action required), the trap is disarmed. The maximum number of traps you can set at one time is equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of one).</p>

                <description>You can set a loaded crossbow that you are holding as a trap at a point within 5 feet of you. When you set a trap, you can designate any number of creatures you know, which don’t trigger it. When a creature that is not behind total cover comes within 30 feet of the trap or ends its turn there, the trap is triggered to shoot it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC {{loaded-question:dc}}) or take piercing damage equal to the crossbow’s damage die + {{dexterity:modifier}}.</description>
