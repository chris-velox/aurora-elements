        <description>
            <p>An elf recites the motions again for the simplest spell she knows, repeating them until she knows they are perfect. With a single, precise stroke, she unleashes a wave of arcane energy, focused into a searing blue beam.</p>
            <p class="indent">A tiefling waves her hands to conjure floating greatswords of humming blue energy, which dance about in mesmerizing and deadly arcs. One blade takes on an aspect of fire, and the other lightning, as she begins to cleave through the goblinoid horde.</p>
            <p class="indent">Waving a black and red checkered banner, a dragonborn king charges into the fore. At his sides are warmages of all houses, a chessboard of elite arcanists, poised to turn the tide of battle.</p>
            <p class="indent">The undisputed masters of cantrips, Warmages turn the most fundamental types of magic into a deadly and precise art.</p>
            <h4>CANTRIP MASTERS</h4>
            <p>While other spellcasters aspire to grander and more complex spells, warmages refine and master the most fundamental magic: cantrips. Warmages wield their magic in the same way that a warrior uses a sword, bow, or axe: as weapons to be perfected and mastered, not as an unknowable force to be feared. In contrast to sorcerers and wizards, their magic is a trainable skill, one that can be mastered by almost anyone with discipline and aptitude. Therefore, warmages stand among the most fearsome of spellcasters, with only the most rudimentary of spells.</p>
            <h4>STRATEGIC GENIUSES</h4>
            <p>Warmages have a long and storied history as grand strategists and tacticians, both in grand battles and personal skirmishes. If a warmage is outgunned or outmanned, they’ll try to outthink their foes, which works more often than not. They demonstrate an efficient kind of pragmatism, owing perhaps to their ability to solve many problems with a few magical tools.</p>
            <h4>ALIGNED FREE AGENTS</h4>
            <p>While some warmages are fully self-taught, the majority join a House, a loose confederation of warmages which practice together and share secrets of the trade. Houses teach invaluable battlefield strategy, but each individual Houses also touts their own brands of tactics and styles of magical tricks. The House of Knights, for example, emphasizes armor and martial prowess, whereas the House of Kings emphasizes battlefield strategy.</p>
            <p class="indent">By way of metaphor, Houses which value honor and teamwork above all else brand themselves after games of strategy, whereas those who epitomize self-reliance name themselves for games of chance. This division in the warmage Houses is representative of a schism that dates back to the earliest warmage masters. Legend has it that the first two masters separated when one decided to found a college. The other, out of spite, built a casino outside its grounds.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A WARMAGE</h4>
            <p>Warmages come from all walks of life, so as you build yours, consider where you first learned the fundamentals of magic, which you would go on to perfect. You might have picked up cantrips from a fellow adventurer or in the early stages of wizarding training. You could even be self-taught. Choose an Arcane Initiation which best fits your character’s history with magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Moreover, consider how you feel about magic as a whole. Are you envious of other spellcasters, or are you confident you could best them regardless? Did you once pine to be a wizard, but found you could never muster enough true magic to form a spell slot? Did you choose warmagistry to hone your talents to their absolute peak, or did you choose it to wield power no warrior can equal?</p>
            <p class="indent">Lastly, consider your prospective warmage house. Though you don’t choose one until reaching third level, your aspirations might shape which house you favor the most. If you would like to dabble with greater arcane magic, the House of Bishops is the best fit. If the clashing of swords at the frontlines piques your interest, consider the House of Knights.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p class="indent">You can make a Warmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Make Strength your third highest if you plan to take the House of Knights. Then choose the cantrips <i>chill touch</i>, <i>fire bolt</i>, <i>prestidigitation</i>, and <i>springheel</i>, and the Adventurer Arcane Initiation. Pick any background.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, you begin to learn the simple, yet potent, brand of spellcasting for which warmages are known.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>You learn four cantrips of your choice from the warmage spell list. You learn additional warmage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warmage table.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warmage cantrips you know and replace it with another warmage cantrip.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warmage spells, since you learn your spells through practice and mental discipline. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells.</p>

You can target a number of creatures equal to the number of damage dice the cantrip deals, and split your damage dice up amongst your targets, to a minimum of 1 die of damage per target. Each attack must target a different creature.</p>

                <p>You conjure a chain and hook made of magical force, which you propel at a creature or unoccupied space you can see within range. When you target a space or a creature of Huge size or larger, your grapnel pulls you to that target in a straight line. You provoke opportunity attacks for this movement as normal. When you target a creature of Large size or smaller, you pull the target up to 10 feet towards you. A creature can make a Strength saving throw to resist this movement.</p>

                <p>As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit, the attack does damage as normal, except that the entire attack deals thunder damage instead of its normal type. Additionally, a clap of thunder rings out from your strike, forcing all creatures except yourself and the target within 5 feet of the target to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 thunder damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 5th level, the melee attack and secondary damage each deal an additional 1d8 thunder damage to their targets. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8/3d8), and 17th level (3d8/4d8).</p>
