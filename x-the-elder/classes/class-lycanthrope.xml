        <description>
        <p>Lycanthropy is an ancient and feared curse, able to turn the most stalwart of men into slavering and savage beasts. They are rightfully feared by a lot of common folk and are able to tear creatures to pieces with their hands alone. Because of this, lycanthropes are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
        <p class="indent">However, not all lycanthropes are evil beasts enslaved to their vicious nature. Those who take their time to train themselves and focus their minds can unlock their bestial power and use it for their own desires. Able to shift into animalistic hybrids and shrug off wounds that would fell mortal men, lycanthropes that follow this path become the ultimate predators. Should their focus fail, grave peril will befall those around them.</p>
        <h4>CREATING A LYCANTHROPE</h4>
        <p>All lycanthropes get their curse from somewhere. Were you born with it, transferred from the blood of your parents? Were you bitten by another lycanthrope during an adventure or attack on your home? Did you get cursed by some craven mage who sought to punish you? Was it a life you chose to accept, being granted such power by a deity?</p>
        <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
        <p>You can make a lycanthrope quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Outlander background.</p>
        <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
        <p>As a lycanthrope, you gain the following class features.</p>
        <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
        <ul class="unstyled">
            <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d10 per lycanthrope level</li>
            <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 10 + your Constitution modifier</li>
            <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per lycanthrope level after 1st</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="caption">PROFICIENCIES</h5>
        <ul class="unstyled mb">
            <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armour, medium armour</li>
            <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons</li>
            <li><strong>Tools:</strong> None</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="unstyled">
            <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Constitution</li>
            <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="caption">EQUIPMENT</h5>
        <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(a) any melee weapon or (b) a shortbow and 20 arrows</li>
            <li>(a) leather armour or (b) hide armour</li>
            <li>(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
            <li>a dagger</li>
        </ul>

            <description>
                <p>At 1st level, you begin to control the lycanthropic curse that now flows through your blood. As an action, you can transform into your Hybrid form as determined by your Lycanthrope Origin feature. This form lasts for 10 minutes. You can speak, use equipment, and wear armor in this form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using an action on your turn. You automatically revert to your normal form if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 Hit Points, or die. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">While you are transformed, you gain the following benefits:</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Feral Might.</strong> You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus, rounded down. You also have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Resilient Hide.</strong> You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks that aren’t silvered. While you are not wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Predatory Strikes.</strong> Your unarmed strikes are considered a melee weapon. You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes. When you use the Attack action to attack a creature with an unarmed strike, you can make another unarmed strike as a bonus action.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 slashing damage. The damage of your unarmed strikes increases as you gain lycanthrope levels, as shown in the Predatory Strikes column of the Lycanthrope Table.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Cursed Weakness.</strong> You have vulnerability to damage from silvered weapons.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Bloodlust.</strong> At the start of your turn, if you’ve taken damage since the start of your last turn, you must make a Wisdom saving throw to maintain control of your humanity. The DC equals 5, or 1/4 of the total damage you’ve taken since the end of your previous turn, whichever number is higher. On a failed save, you must move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. If there is more than one possible target, the DM chooses the target. You then regain control of your character for the remainder of your turn.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you are under an effect that prevents you from concentrating (like the Barbarian’s rage feature), you automatically fail this saving throw.</p>
                <p class="indent">The benefits of this feature replace the rules for Lycanthropy within the <em>Monster Manual</em>.</p>

The DC equals 5, or 1/4 of the total damage you’ve taken since the end of your previous turn, whichever number is higher. On a failed save, you must move directly towards the nearest creature to you and use the Attack action against that creature. If there is more than one possible target, the DM chooses the target.
