        <description>
            <p>A tiefling leaps atop the back of a red dragon, slashing their twin swords in a flurry as they dance across its spine. Every strike only strengthens their resolve, a new majesty radiating from their movements and attacks. The dragon turns its head to incinerate the pest, but the tiefling only matches its red-hot breath with another leap, and their own scream of delight.</p>
            <p class="indent">A pair of elves fight side by side, slowly advancing towards a lone troll. The elder takes the lead, carefully slipping under and around the brute's claws while their apprentice waits for an opening. The elder whistles sharply, and the younger falls on the troll in an instant, sending it reeling backwards. As a pair, master and apprentice move in for the kill.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human fights to their last, kicking and screaming as the fires of their passion burn brighter and brighter in their blood. Static licks at their fingers as they blur across the battlefield, a living tempest of fury and excitement, before a great pair of gold-crimson wings erupt from their back and they take to the sky in a brilliant cascade of light and fire.</p>
            <p class="indent">Paragons are as varied as can be, but are united in their irrepressible daring, flair for dramatics, and a willingness to go beyond any limits in pursuit of their goals. Their incredible determination leads them down paths few dare follow, and no threat, no danger, will break their limitless conviction.</p>
            <h4>STRIVING FOR PERFECTION</h4>
            <p>A paragon is utterly defined by what their believe in. Anyone can attempt to master a skill or further a cause, but a paragon will accept nothing less than perfection with their chosen art. What sparks this devotion varies from paragon to paragon, be it a talent, ideal, philosophy, quest, or faith, but no matter the source, they will pursue it undaunted and eager for more.</p>
            <p class="indent">Perhaps because of their devotion, paragons can be prone to pride or boasting. Plenty feel the need to take their turn in the limelight, showing off their talent for all the world to see, and all paragons find satisfaction in the fruit of their labour, and take joy in displaying it when they have the chance—the products of years of practice do make an excellent show.</p>
            <h4>ANCIENT FABLES</h4>
            <p>Paragons are storybooks waiting to happen. Their relentless nature in pursuit of their art leads them towards the kinds of acts that forever immortalise them in myth and legend. For a paragon, a life of adventure is only a natural consequence of their devotion, and goes hand in hand with their own quest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For paragons, the call to adventure is second only to the call of glory. To be sung of over the din of a rowdy tavern; to be the wondrous hero of a children's bedtime story; to live on as a hero of folklore; all these things are far more attractive to many paragons than something as simple as gold or treasure. For that reason, many of those same paragons aren't afraid of death, so long as their demise makes an excellent story. After all, they live as long as their legacies, and legends never die.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whatever their goals, a paragon makes for an excellent member of any adventuring party, offering their martial skill and irrepressible spirit, and always holding to the bottomless well of determination that drives them forwards.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PARAGON</h4>
            <p>When creating your paragon, you should ask yourself two questions above all others. What does your paragon seek to champion, and why? How was your paragon introduced to the art they chose? Did they come upon it by chance, or were they raised to pursue it? If you were taught, who taught you? What kind of relationship do you have with your teachers? Have you made any decisions you regret in pursuit of your goals? Will you make those decisions again, if you have to?</p>
            <p class="indent">What led you to becoming an adventurer? If your aims are artistic or intellectual, you might seek to unearth lost lore, or to find the perfect inspiration for your work. If you seek glory and nothing else, you might search for great beasts to slay or forgotten relics to discover, or perhaps you wander the land, looking to right any wrongs you can find.</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider why you have such passion for what drives you. The dauntless nature of a paragon is rare, and is often forged in exceptional circumstances. The origins of your fiery spirit can have a profound affect on your future.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a paragon quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to wield heavy weapons or two light weapons (or a rapier). You should make Charisma your next highest ability score. Second, choose the folk hero background.</p>
            <h5>PARAGON'S MARK</h5>
            <p>Paragons universally seek recognition, and many choose to identify themselves with a quirk, eccentricity, or calling card. Because of this, many paragons possess an uncanny ability to recognise other paragons by their marks.</p>
            <p class="indent">Did your paragon choose their mark, or did they inherit it? Are there others who use it? What does it mean to them? Do they want it to inspire awe, terror, or something else entirely? At your option, you can roll on the Paragon's Marks table to help inspire a mark for your paragon.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">PARAGON'S MARKS</h5>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Mark</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>You dress flamboyantly, in bright colours, and wear the pattern of an exotic animal or monster.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You constantly taunt your opponents, challenging, mocking, and baiting them at every opportunity.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>You take a body part from enemies you spare—an eye, finger, or ear—to make sure they don't forget. You hope they'll grow stronger and fight you again.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You leave a personal token on the bodies of your defeated foes, such as a small effigy or a coin.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>You never stop smiling, even in the face of death.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>Whenever you enter a fight, you cry out your signature motto, maxim, or catchphrase.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h5>CATALYST</h5>
            <p>A paragon's devotion to their art is a special thing, and rarely emerges without a catalyst; a defining experience that sparks their obsessive fervor and begins their journey as a paragon.</p>
            <p class="indent">How much does your paragon's catalyst mean to them? Does it hang over their head, always pushing them forward, or was it just the first stepping stone on their journey? Does it haunt them, or does it give them strength when they need it? At your option, you can roll on the Catalysts table to help inspire a catalyst for your paragon.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">CATALYSTS</h5>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Catalyst</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Your home needed a hero, and no-one came. You won't let that happen to anyone ever again.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>The fables your parents told you as a child are your fondest memory, and inspire you even now.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Your mentor promised to teach you everything they knew, but died before they could. Now, you journey to learn what they might have taught you.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Your family groomed you for one art, but entirely by accident, you found the one you chose instead.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>You were inspired by another's love for the art that you would go on to make your own</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You never needed a catalyst. You were born for your art—there has never been anything else.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h5>WEAKNESS</h5>
            <p>Paragons strive for perfection, but by definition, that goal means that they aren't perfect. Many even display behaviour directly in contrast with their own goals and ideals</p>
            <p class="indent">Does your paragon hide their weaknesses, ashamed that others might discover their imperfection? Do they wear them proudly, or do they simply view them as one more obstacle to overcome? Maybe they aren't even aware of their weaknesses. At your option, you can roll on the Weaknesses table to help inspire a weakness for your paragon.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">WEAKNESSES</h5>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Weakness</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td><b><i>Recklessness.</i></b> You don't recognise danger, and run headfirst towards it without any caution.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td><b><i>Loyalty.</i></b> You'd doom the world to save a friend, and risk your life for an enemy you empathise with.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td><b><i>Hubris.</i></b> You always think you're the best person for the job, no matter who might be most skilled.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td><b><i>Wrath.</i></b> You can't forgive, and you can't forget. Your anger blinds you to your own bad decisions.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td><b><i>Pride.</i></b> You take every insult personally, and you can't turn down a challenge you're given.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td><b><i>Ambition.</i></b> You hunger for power, even when you don't need it or it has dangerous side-effects.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <description>
                <p>Beginning when you reach 2nd level, your sheer nerve allows you to perform great feats of skill. Your nerve is represented by a number of nerve points. Your paragon level determines the maximum number of points you have, as shown in the Nerve Points column of the Paragon table.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various nerve features. You start knowing the features listed below, and gain more nerve features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent">You regain all your nerve points when you finish a short or long rest. You regain 1 nerve point the first time on any turn that you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or you score a critical hit with a weapon attack against a hostile creature.</p>
                <p class="indent">Some of your nerve features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Nerve save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <h5>CLEVER RETORT</h5>
                <p>When a creature that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction and expend 1 nerve point to add your Charisma modifier to your AC until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack. You can't use this feature if you're wielding a shield.</p>
                <h5>DARING RUSH</h5>
                <p>You can use a bonus action and spend 1 nerve point to take the Dash action. If you do, you can move along vertical surfaces without falling until the end of your turn.</p>

                <p>When a creature misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction and expend 1 nerve point to make an attack with a melee weapon against that creature.</p>

                    <h5 class="caption">OPTIONAL RULE - DARING ACT</h5>
                    <p>Your Dungeon Master might feel that your paragon character should be rewarded for acting recklessly. If so, the following optional rule presents a method of encouraging daring, risky behaviour.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b><i>Daring Act.</i></b> Whenever you perform a daring act, you can regain nerve. A daring act should be risky and dramatic; it should take a great deal of bravery, and if it fails, should have a high chance of disaster. If you succeed, you regain 1 nerve point.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Ask your Dungeon Master if an act counts before you attempt it. Your Dungeon Master decides what counts as a daring act, and can cause you to regain nerve even if you didn't ask beforehand.</p>

                <p>If a flair has any prerequisites, you must meet them to learn that flair. You can learn the flair at the same time you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite in a flair refers to your level in this class.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You have witnessed a legendary being firsthand and been inspired. The sheer awe evoked by these beings is enough to spark reverence, but not all who behold their power turn to worship. Paragons of this virtue don't study these beings to imitate what they do, but instead to imitate what they are.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you take an aspirant under your wing. Choose your aspirant's stat block—Agile Aspirant, Mighty Aspirant, or Mystical Aspirant (see the next page). Your aspirant is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands.</p>
                <p class="indent">In combat, your aspirant shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. Your aspirant has a special action—called an inspired action—that it can't take unless you use your bonus action on your turn and spend 1 nerve point to inspire it to. Your aspirant can move and use other actions and reactions without your command.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your aspirant has proficiency two skills of your choice. It also has proficiency with simple and martial weapons, light armour, and the saving throws in its stat block. Your aspirant always uses your proficiency bonus instead of its own.</p>
                <p class="indent">For each paragon level after 3rd, your aspirant gains hit points equal to 5 + its Constitution modifier, and gains one additional hit die. If your aspirant is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as a player character would.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can spend 8 hours in any populated area attracting another aspirant, which can be the same type of aspirant or a different one. The DM determines what might convince a new aspirant to join you; a small favour or proof of your skill or achievements would be appropriate. You can't have more than one aspirant companion at a time.</p>
                <h5>ASPIRANT QUIRKS</h5>
                <p class="indent">Your aspirant is a character with its own personality traits, ideals, and flaws. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Aspirant Quirks table when you choose this virtue at 3rd level, or when you take a new aspirant, to establish quirks for your aspirant and define your relationship with it.</p>

                    <p>The aspirant companion stat blocks present the aspirant as human. If you'd rather your companion be another race, your Dungeon Master might allow you to slightly adjust your aspirant's statistics.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, an elven companion might have the elf's Darkvision and Trance traits, and a halfling companion might be Small instead of Medium. You shouldn't adjust the aspirant's ability scores, or add features such as Savage Attacks or any feature with a limited number of uses between rests.</p>

                <p>Beginning when you reach 3rd level, your emotion manifests in bursts of untamed magic. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting, and the next page for the virtue of passion spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Cantrips.</i></b> You learn four cantrips of your choice from the virtue of passion spell list. You learn an additional virtue of passion cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spell Slots.</i></b> The Virtue of Passion Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</i></b> You know three 1st-level virtue of passion spells of your choice</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Virtue of Passion Spellcasting table shows when you learn more virtue of passion spells of 1st level or higher. Each spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new virtue of passion spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the virtue of passion spells you know and replace it with another spell from the virtue of passion spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Spellcasting Ability.</i></b> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your virtue of passion spells, since your magic is fueled by the power of your emotion. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier whenever you set the saving throw DC for a virtue of passion spell you cast and whenever you make an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
