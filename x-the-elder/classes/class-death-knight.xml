        <description>
            <p>A steady flow of blood drips from the human's blade. He grins through his decaying visage, as his sword's edge plunges deep into the side of his next victim; it clears gristle and bone, feasting on the scarlet essence as it cleaves through the knight's enemy.</p>
            <p class="indent">A chill slowly leaches the heat from a damp hallway. The lone orc pulls her blades from the brittle body of her victim. Their last breath dancing through the air, a metaphor manifest, as their life escapes their body.</p>
            <p class="indent">The stench of rot and decay radiate from the dwarf. He raises his hands and in a moment, the dead walk again. Their bony claws steeped in pestilence and disease, the dwarf has not only conquered death. He has mastered it.</p>
            <h4>DEATH WAS BUT A STEPPING STONE</h4>
            <p>When creating your Death Knight, consider the reason for your resurrection. How and why did the entity responsible for granting you the gift of undeath choose you. Do you feel a sense of duty or anger toward this individual who ripped you from your grave? Consider your past life and the oath you had chosen, do you feel a sense of betrayal for having to break this oath, or has hindsight made you bitter toward your old life and the ways of the light? Regardless of how you play your Death Knight, you will take a new forsaken oath, steeped in turmoil.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A DEATH KNIGHT</h4>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">PLAYING THE DEATH KNIGHT</h5>
                <p>While the Death Knight has rules for creation as early as 1st level, it is recommended for 5th level parties and above. Upon death paladins may transition to the Death Knight if their DM wishes to offer this option. A paladin resurrected as a Death Knight has their Charisma and Wisdom abilities swapped. Additionally, it is important to note that while you have been resurrected, for game play purposes, you are still a humanoid of your chosen race. However, at the DM's discretion you may choose to be treated as Undead.</p>
            </div>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can build a Death Knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the Soldier or Noble background.</p>

You must spend one hour inscribing your weapon, which may be completed during a short rest. You may inscribe up to two weapons, and you cannot be disarmed of your Rune Weapons while you are conscious. If you inscribe a third weapon, you must choose one of your previous two weapons from which to remove the Runes.</p>

            <p>A 15-foot-radius circle of rot and decay appears, centered on a point with range and lasting for the duration. This blighted area reeks of disease and emanates a festering pain within those who stand inside it. The area is difficult terrain. Any creature other than the Death Knight that starts its turn in the area takes 2d6 plus your wisdom modifier necrotic damage. Any other creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected by a random disease. On a failed save, roll a d4. On a 1, the target suffers Scarlet Fever; on a 2, the target suffers Frost Fever; on a 3, the target suffers Blighting Fever; on a 4, you may select one disease from Scarlet Fever, Frost Fever, or Blighting Fever.</p>
