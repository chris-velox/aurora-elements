		<description>
			<p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p>
			<p class="indent">Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p>
			<p class="indent">Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p>
			<h4>RAW MAGIC</h4>
			<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>
			<p class="indent">The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.</p>
			<h4>UNEXPLAINED POWERS</h4>
			<p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A SORCERER</h4>
			<p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p>
			<p class="indent">How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells shield and magic missile.</p>

			<p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you have 2 1st-level spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself that grants you greater control of magic than other casters will ever know.</p>
            <p class="indent">You no longer have spell slots. Instead, you have a reservoir of magic within you that is represented by Mana Points, which allows you to create a variety of effects. Nevertheless, you are considered to have spell slots of the levels you are able to cast, as defined in the Sorcerer class table above, for the purpose of accessing features that require access to spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">You have 8 mana points, and you gain additional points when you level up, as shown in the Sorcerer class table above.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you have more spellcasting levels in other classes than you do in sorcerer, use the default rules from the PHB for the Font of Magic feature instead of this feature. If you have more sorcerer levels than other spellcasting levels, you lose any spell slots granted by those classes, and instead count the spellcasting levels of those classes toward your sorcerer level when determining your maximum number of mana points.</p>
            <h5>MANA-FUELED SPELLS</h5>
            <p>When you wish to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you expend mana points to momentarily construct a spell slot of the desired level, as specified in the table below. The maximum spell level you can construct is specified in the Sorcerer class table. You cannot reduce your mana points below 0, and you regain all mana points when you complete a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. When you create a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you may not create another slot of that level until you complete a long rest.</p>

            <h5>IMBUING TOUCH</h5>
            <p>As an action, you can touch one nonmagical weapon and spend 2 mana points to imbue it with magic for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.</p>
            <h5>SORCEROUS FORTITUDE</h5>
            <p>As an action, you can spend any number of mana points up to your sorcerer level to roll a d4 for each point expended. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the total rolled that last until the end of your next long rest.</p>

            <p>When you cast a spell, by expending 2 mana points, you can imbue it with an illusory effect that draws the attention of creatures affected by it, distracting them from other nearby dangers. Once a creature is struck by a spell attack from the spell or fails its initial saving throw against the spell, the next attack roll against it by a creature other than you before the beginning of your next turn has advantage.</p>

            <p>When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage in an area of effect without secondary effects, you can spend a number of mana points equal to the spell’s level to cause the energy of the spell to linger. At the start of your next turn, the lingering spell’s damage applies again, imposing any corresponding saving throws or making any relevant attack rolls. Creatures damaged by the echo receive only half damage. For instance, if the spell would ordinarily include a saving throw for half damage, a creature that succeeds on the echo’s saving throw would receive a quarter of the original damage.</p>

			<p>Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
			<p>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
