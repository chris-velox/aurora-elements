            <h5>PACT KIT</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you gain the benefits of the <i>Pact of the Alchemist</i> feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your patron lends you a modified potion brewing kit that combines the alchemist tools with the herbalism kit. The kit is covered in runic scripture and runes. You gain proficiency in Herbalism kits and Alchemistâ€™s tools, and double your proficiency bonus with any checks you make using these. The kit is treated as one or the other, and you decide which when choosing this Pact Boon.</p>
            <p class="indent">The kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Any creation of potions take half as long compared to a regular herbalism kit. You can create any potion using this kit. If you have never made a specific potion before, you can attempt to create it, but you only add your proficiency bonus once to the creation process. If you succeed, you add your proficiency bonus twice to any future rolls made to create that potion.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your kit, you can perform a 1-hour Ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This Ceremony can be performed during a short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous kit. The kit turns to ash when you die.</p>

            <p class="indent">Your patron has blessed one of your eyes with magical energy. The eye changes colour to match your patron, and may have a particular change in iris. The changes are recognisable to those talking to you, but they may not know why. You gain proficiency with Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and you double your proficiency bonus with this skill. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Dim light doesnâ€™t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks. In addition, you become more attentive to your surroundings. You add your +5 to your Passive Wisdom (Perception).</p>

            <h5>PACT MASK</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you gain the benefits of the <i>Pact of the Mask</i> feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your patron lends you an illusory mask. The mask can be donned or doffed as a bonus action. When you wear this mask, you gain proficiency in Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion). If you already have proficiency in these skills, you double your proficiency bonus with them.</p>
            <p class="indent">While wearing this mask, your real identity is disguised from others. You have two additional fictional identities stored in the mask. These identities must be of the same body type as you. They have names, documentation to support them, and most importantly, a different face. Instead of appearing as your pact mask, your mask can create an illusion to trick people into believing they see the face of one of these identities when they look at the mask.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures with an Intelligence of 8 + your Charisma modifier or lower fail to see past the disguise. A creature with an Intelligence higher than this score can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine if you are wearing the mask. The DC for this check is equal to 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a success, the creature sees past this illusion. Creatures with true sight automatically succeed this check, even if their Intelligence is below the threshold. You can designate creatures to see past this effect.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can change the mask to show another identity stored in the mask. Any creature watching you as you take this action must make a Wisdom (Perception) check, where the DC is your Warlock spell save DC. Any creature directly interacting with you or you designate automatically succeeds this check.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can perform a special ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done over a short or long rest. When you perform this ritual, you can convert a magic mask into your pact mask. When you perform this ritual, you can change the appearance of the mask. If you lose your mask, you can perform this ritual to receive a replacement from your patron. You can offer gold equal to 5 times your Warlock level to alter the identities you have from this feature, and any documentation you have supporting them from this feature is altered to support the new or changed identity. It destroys the previous mask. The mask turns to ash when you die.</p>

            <h5>PACT ORB</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you gain the benefits of the <i>Pact of the Orb</i> feature. You use Intelligence instead of Charisma for the number of charges the orb has.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your patron gives you a crystal ball enchanted with magical energy. The orb acts as a spellcasting focus for your Warlock spells. It floats no more than 5 feet from you, and you can control its location as a free action on your turns. It cannot move more than 5 feet away from you or else it becomes a mundane object until it is returned within 5 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent">The orb has a number of charges equal to your Charisma modifier. As a bonus action on your turns, you can expend any number of charges from the Orb to add a value to a single spell attack equal to the charges spent. In addition, you can expend any number of charges from the Orb to increase a single spell save DC on a spell you cast by half the number of charges expended (rounded down).</p>
            <p class="indent">You regain all expended uses of this feature on a short rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action on your turn, you can recall an orb that is more than 5 feet away from you or stored in your extradimensional space, to teleport into your hand. The orb cannot be used to damage a creature or object and deals no damage when done so. It disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the orb (no action required), or if you die.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can transform one magical orb into your pact orb by performing a special ritual while you hold the orb. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the orb, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact orb thereafter. You canâ€™t affect an artifact or a sentient orb in this way. The orb ceases being your pact orb if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different orb, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>

            <h5>Pact Quill</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you gain the benefits of the <i>Pact of the Quill</i> feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">A rare gift, your patron gifts you a quill with a unique and recognisable design. The quill can be used as a writing implement, and the quality of your handwriting with it is always flawless. You can channel your energy through your quill as you write on a surface, infusing the spell in your ink to be cast at a later time. Choose a spell of or lower than a level that you can cast, with a casting time of one action. You cast that spell as part of this feature, expending a Warlock Spell Slot, any material components along with it, and fine ink worth 25 times the spell level in gp, but the spell doesnâ€™t come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when you activate the ink, requiring an action to do so. If the spell infused into the ink is a concentration spell, you must concentrate on it when you activate it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell takes effect when you activate it in this manner. If the ink has not been activated, but the ink is tampered with or the surface it is on is destroyed, the effect ends. The ink remains for 1 week, after which it becomes non-magical ink and an unused spell stored this way is lost. You can have a maximum number of infused spells equal to half your Proficiency bonus. If you try and use this feature again but the maximum amount is in use, the oldest infused ink becomes non-magical.</p>
            <p class="indent">The magical writing is written in the language of your patron, and a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check made by another creature can determine the spell stored in the ink. Ink that is used or expires in some method fade away of the course of a day.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you lose your quill, you can perform a 1-hour Ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This can be performed during a short or Long Rest, and it destroys the previous quill. The quill turns to ash when you die.</p>
