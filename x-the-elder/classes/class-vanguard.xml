        <description>
            <p>As the angry mob continues to rain blows against the line of shields before them, a lone human soldier shores up her defenses and prepares for more blows to come. When she finally senses a break in the battle, she unleashes a swinging strike that knocks her attackers to the floor.</p>
            <p class="indent">With the battle raging all around him, the unarmoured dwarf runs recklessly into the centre of his enemies swinging his greataxe gleefully. He laughs as his foes descend upon him, not knowing that each drop of his blood they draw will only make him stronger.</p>
            <p class="indent">Raising her sword high into the air, the tiefling warrior weaves into the fray with a triumphant cry. Her enemies lose heart as, with each missed blow, she only seems to cut them down faster.</p>
            <p class="indent">Vanguards are martial warriors who lead the charge in battle. Many make a living as mercenaries, clearing the way for their weaker allies. Others are soldiers, protecting the free lands of the world from dangerous threats. And some are lone warriors who actively seek out and relish the thrill of battle.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A VANGUARD</h4>
            <p>The most important thing to remember when making a vanguard character is that they have an eagerness to enter any battle, no matter how small or unimportant. They spend their lives seeking out a worthy challenge, whether it be travelling the world looking for the strongest adversaries or leading the charge in a war. They are only content when fighting against the greatest odds. Are you a retired soldier who has turned to a life of adventure to find a challenge? Have you been sent from your lord on a special mission?</p>
            <p class="indent">As avid combatants, vanguards may belong to any alignment. Consider how your alignment may have affected your path until now, including the masters or causes you have fought for.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a vanguard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Strength and Constitution should be your highest scores. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a vanguard, you gain the following class features.</p>

            <p>Guardian tactics allow a combatant to draw strength from the failed attacks of others. Vanguards who use this tactic are staunch defenders and focus almost entirely on defensive combat, gaining strength each time the enemy fails to strike them. They typically protect themselves with heavy armour and shields, waiting for a break in the combat to unleash their most powerful strikes.</p>

On a hit, you deal your normal damage and attempt to knock an enemy up to 2 sizes larger than you backwards.

If you win the contest, the target is pushed away from you. If the target is up to 1 size larger than you, it is pushed back 10 feet.

                <p>You attempt to draw the ire of your enemy, forcing it to attack you instead of your allies. You make a weapon attack against a single target within range. On a hit, the target has disadvantage on all attacks against creatures other than yourself until the start of your next turn.</p>
