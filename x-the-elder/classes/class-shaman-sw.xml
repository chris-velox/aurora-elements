            <p class="indent">Walking in the forest at night, you may meet a man or a woman sitting and meditating by the largest tree in the forest. Various carved wooden figurines, a pouch full of various herbs and spices along with a burning incense are scattered around the person. When you come closer, you hear the chantings of a ritual meant to appease the natural spirits, and as you come up next to the person, the spirits materialize and envelop you and the sitting person. At that moment, he or she opens their eyes and stare right at you, making you see directly into their eyes, which looks dead and shows signs of having seen much more than you will ever imagine in your mortal life.</p>
            <h4>SPIRITUAL CONNECTION</h4>
            <p>Shamans serve as the direct connection between the mortal world and the realms of spirits, being called by the spirits to speak and act for them among mortals. These spirits come in a variety of forms, ranging from nature spirits to the souls of fallen ancestors. By bargaining and negotiating with spirits, an occulist is granted power from the spirits, both to serve the spirits’ goals, but also in part as a reward for serving them. The powers granted stems from the very energies permeating throughout nature and reflects it by granting effects resembling the elements of nature.</p>
            <h4>SOUL VESSEL</h4>
            <p>While gaining physical and magical prowess from the spirits, a Shaman never has true control of their powers, merely serving as a vessel for the spirits to channel their energies through. To keep the spirits happy and to ensure that they keep they powers, Shamans often make ritual sacrifices and offer prayers and services to the spirits.</p>
            <h4>THE GIFT OF THE SPIRITS</h4>
            <p>As an Shaman becomes more powerful, they become more attached to the Spirit World, and gradually, they transition into becoming more of a living spirit themselves, being detached from mortal problems and fueling their own spiritual powers instead of relying on the spirits they worship and serve. At that point, an Shaman becomes neither mortal nor immortal, neither living nor dead, just something inbetween.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN SHAMAN</h4>
            <p>When making your Shaman, you should consider why your character has such a close bond with nature and the spirits in particular. Perhaps you are a part of a tribe that worships your ancestors which takes their form as spirits, or maybe you have witnessed a murder in the forest, which have traumatized you and brought you closer to the spiritual wo. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, falling from a tree or down a waterfall and barely surviving, maybe in part due to spirits saving you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Have you always been an adventurer as part of your spiritual calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a mausoleum or graveyard? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Shaman quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability modifier, followed by either Strength or Dexterity. Secondly, you should take the Outlander background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an shaman, you gain the following class features.</p>

                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per shaman level after 1st</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>any simple weapon, a flail, a morning star or a whip</li>

                <h5>METAL ARMOR</h5>
                <p>Like druids, shamans will refuse to wear armor or shields primarily made of metal. Among non-magical armor, shamans can wear leather, studded leather and hide, as they are primarily made of non-metal materials. Other armor may have variants that allow them to be worn by shamans.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Your study of nature and the spirits of the world have given you the ability to cast spells using the magic of natural spirits in the world. See Chapter 10 in the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the shaman spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELLS)</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Shaman spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional Shaman cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>The Shaman table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your shaman spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <i>cause fear</i>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of Shaman spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the shaman spell list. When you do so, choose a number of shaman spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your shaman level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots of the level or higher. For example, if you are a 5rd-level shaman with a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared shaman spells can include five spells of 1st and 2nd level, in any combination. You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of shaman spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast a shaman spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal and also doesn’t expend a spell slot. The ritual version of a spell can only be cast at its lowest level possible.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an druidic focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 10th level, you gain the ability to hone your ability to cast spells as rituals. After focusing for 10 minutes, you cause four pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see, creating a 15 by 15-foot square centered around you with a pillar at each corner of the square. While inside the square and at least 2 pillars are remaining, you can cast spells as a ritual without increasing the casting time; the casting time of the ritual is equal to the casting time when casting the spell using a spell slot.</p>
                <p class="indent">Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you cannot target ground under a creature. Each pillar has AC 10 and 20 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 5-foot radius. The rubble lasts until cleared. The pillars last for 1 hour or until they’re destroyed. Each spell you cast as a ritual while inside the pillars reduces their lifetime by 10 minutes.</p>
