        <description>
            <p>Humming to herself to remember the first few steps and her line, a young elf wearing a regal tutu takes to the stage to perform for her recital. Her dance is accompanied by wind helping her leap, fire acting as her spotlight and lightning adding the trusty razzle dazzle to her spinning.</p>
            <p class="indent">Mesmerizingly twirling and whirling with ribbons and colorful cloth, a half elf brings life to the tavern alongside a good song. Unfortunately for the crowd, he’s robbing them blind, cutting purses with an expertly hidden dagger up his sleeve. His fellow dancers are juggling swords and performing mock combat to help keep eyes off him.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hurriedly, many small children find their seats in the town square, a traveling troupe is in town. Out comes a gnome and the story begins. Through the dance, the tale of the Great Ginevra the Good is told, behind stage, other dancers conjure up the scenery to enhance the performance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of what kind of dance, movement unites these individuals as their performance aids them in their walk of life. A dancer is swift, coordinated and full of stamina, they dance for many different reasons that can range from hand to hand combat, to deception and distractions, to commanding the elements, to storytelling and anything in between.</p>
            <h4>TEMPO AND STAMINA</h4>
            <p>Anyone can dance, and dancers are a welcoming sort usually, to spot the best of the best, one need look closer, dancers who work day after day to improve the fluidity in their rhythm, these individuals develop a personal touch to their dance that cannot be taught. There is nothing like the thrill of a dance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Dancers bring flexibility to the table, they are quick on a dime in battle, navigating through the fray with excellent dodging capabilities. Dancers are specialists in using their momentum to swing the fight in their favor, supporting allies and hindering foes while flying through the battlefield through precise steps.</p>
            <h4>SEEKING ADVENTURE</h4>
            <p>Depending on the type of dancer, there are many reasons to explore cursed tombs, loot legendary treasures, visit wondrous cities, and observe strange creatures. Wanderlust is a feeling known to almost all dancers, something in them tells them they aren’t destined to stay where they are and dance to merely the local tune.</p>
            <p class="indent">A dancer with adventure under their belt can brag about it at the annual dance-off or joke about how their sure footing saved their clumsy companion. They tend to be of the chaotic sort, favoring personal freedom, living life carefree and without inhibitions. After all, what is the purpose of performing if there’s no one around to see it?</p>
            <h4>CREATING A DANCER</h4>
            <p>A dancer always has a reason as to why they dance. This purpose guides them in life. Whether you were simply the best dancer at your local tavern, or whether you grew up with formal training. Without joy, there is no spring in your step.</p>
            <p class="indent">Why do you dance? Is it a hobby you have excelled at? Or does it mean something deeper to you? Maybe you grew up in a culture that valued dancing, maybe it was something that brought comfort in times of sadness. Or perhaps you have ambition of rising through social circles, and balls and other such parties are your ticket to success.</p>
