        <description>
            <p>A young elven man sits peacefully under a tree on the side of the road. As a group of bandits emerge from the shadows, trying to take advantage of this unarmed traveler, the elven man snaps his fingers. Within seconds, a full suit of glistening white platemail apparates onto his body, and a massive greatsword covered in runes appears in his hands.</p>
            <p class="indent">Surrounded by two huge trolls, a goliath stands firm with his two scimitars glowing brightly in his hands. With one fluid movement he launches one of his scimitars, sinking it deeply into one of the troll’s head. It stops in its tracks, screeching in pain as it struggles to remove the blade. He turns to the other, sword in hand, ready to face it one-on-one.</p>
            <p class="indent">Three humans stare in awe at the gaping maw of an ancient red dragon. They see a bright, burning glow begin to emerge from its throat, and prepare to meet their gods. As the blazing fury of fire billows around them, they remain unharmed. Standing firmly in front of them clad in a knight’s breastplate, a woman’s shield is glowing red hot, blocking them from its destruction.</p>
            <p class="indent">An arcane armsman combines their natural fighting abilities with long, intensive studies of the arcane. Unlike traditional magic users, armsmen use their powers to augment their weapons, armor, and bodies to push themselves beyond their limit in combat.</p>
            <h4>A SKILLFUL BALANCE</h4>
            <p>Scholars and swordsmen alike, arcane armsmen spend much of their time studying their trade. They spend hours in the daylight perfecting their swordsmanship, and equally long nights engrossed in tomes, learning and creating beautifully intricate runes to fuel their magic. This leaves little free time, so most armsmen devote their entire lives to the craft.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A ARCANE ARMSMAN</h4>
            <p>As you build your arcane armsman, think about two aspects of your character’s background: Where did they learn the way of the arcane arts, and why did they choose to make it their life? Were they trained by a veteran armsman, perhaps from a royal knight? Or did you research these powers of your own volition, thirsting for a higher form of combat?</p>
            <p class="indent">You may have been trained by a wise old noble, searching for his successor among the commoners. Maybe you were sent to a knight’s academy as a young adult, being taught the ancient history of magic alongside the art of war. Or perhaps you simply heard tell of legendary warriors who can channel the weave, and worked incessantly to become one yourself. Why did you choose the life of an armsman over that of a normal soldier? Your mind is as sharp as your sword-- your two most powerful weapons.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an arcane armsman quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on heavy or finesse weapons. Your next highest score should be Intelligence. Second, choose the Noble background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an arcane armsman, you gain the following class features.</p>

                <p>Your arcane knowledge allows you to imbue your weapon with magical qualities. Over the course of a long rest, you can assign a single melee weapon that you’re proficient in as your spellbound blade. The weapon gains the following benefits:</p>

                    <li>Your attacks made with your spellbound blade count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</li>

                    <li>You can dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it can be recalled as a bonus action.</li>

                <p>When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

                <p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
