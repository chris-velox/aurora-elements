        <description>
            <p>Reaching into a small bag around her neck held by a golden-linked chain, an elf removes a pinch of fine, sparkling powder, murmurs beneath her breath and blows the dust across her hand. Her assailant’s eyes roll into the back of his head as he slumps to the floor, snoring.</p>
            <p class="indent">A wirey gnome rolls away from a poorly aimed crossbow bolt, springing to his feet. Though battle roars about them, his whispers are heard by the soldier. Moments later, the he throws his hands up to ward off an unseen horror, drops his weapon and screams.</p>
            <p class="indent">Looking about the desert disapprovingly, a tan skinned tiefling closes his eyes and concetrates. Upon opening them, the landscape is transformed into a mist-shrouded forest. Dream made reality.</p>
            <p class="indent">While some draw magic from pure knowledge and training, Dreamers use the abstract, intuitive part of their mind to connect and drawpower from the Dream Plane. Using mere thought, Dreamers can step into and use the parallel dream plane to manifest change in the material world and its denizens.</p>
            <h4>MANIPULATORS OF FANCY</h4>
            <p>Harnessing and manipulating the magics of the dream-like Feywild is a difficult task, as few are able to understand, let alone control, the indefinite Feywild. Dreamers can weave, unravel and even replace the innermost secrets and desires of those nearby. Being inexorably linked to a dream plane that defies the natural laws of the material world takes great strength of mind. With this power, Dreamers can force sleep upon the restless, travel swiftly, and even breathe life into one’s very dreams and nightmares.</p>
            <h4>THE DREAM IS REAL</h4>
            <p>The magic of the Feywild can be harnessed and used to access dreams and change reality. Dreamers can physically enter the dreamscape of the Feywild to manipulate the material world, access dreams and thoughts, travel great distances in a short time or augment one’s magical abilities or battle prowess. Experienced dreamers can be devious combatants, striking out mentally and physically from both the material and dreamworld planes.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A DREAMER</h4>
            <p>The first thing you should decide when creating a Dreamer is what decision or event occurred providing your character with access or a connection to the Feywild, specifically its dream-like realms. As a starting character you will need to choose whether you will serve the Seelie (Summer Court), the Unseelie (Winter Court) or even the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell! Your decision will determine how your powers manifest as you gain levels in this class. Will you choose a path under the protective, nature-abiding, power-hungry Summer Fey? The cold, calculating Winter Fey who promote survival by sheer will? Or would you harness the evil, negative energies of the Shadowfell, in exchange for your eternal life? Much of a Dreamer’s power manifests as magical manipulation of another’s mind or the physical space around you.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a Dreamer you will also want to know what you want to do with this power. Are you looking to augment your magical studies or abilities? Do you intend to join the ranks of a Fey or Toril army? Do you seek a way to connect with mystical creatures like centaurs or dryads? Have you been tricked or persuaded into the Feywild by an Oni or hag? Do you seek out or have you been trapped by the domains of Strahd von Zarovich or the Raven Queen? Your DM can help you determine what role you serve within a Court or whether your connection even requires service. Some dreamers choose a path of protection or support. Others choose a more violent path through magic or weapon mastery. No matter what path or choices you make for your Dreamer, it will be the creative application of dreams and nightmares that separate Dreamers with their heads in the clouds from those firmly grounded in the workings of the subconscious mind.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a dreamer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the Sage background. Third, choose the message and ray of frost cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells faerie fire and magic missile.</p>

            <p>At 1st level, your dreamwalking brings you in proximity to the Feywild. Choose a Court of the Faeries you will enter into service to: Seelie, Unseelie, or the Shadowfell. They will shape the course of your dream powers. Each Court is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you an Avatar at 3rd level and additional features at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>

            <p>Your deep experience with dreams allows you to connect subconsciously to the dream plane of the Feywild. Its dreamlike realms allow you to move about and manipulate the material world around you. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of the class description for the dreamer spell list.</p>
            <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
            <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the dreamer spell list. You learn additional dreamer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Dreamer table.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Dreamer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these dreamer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell magic missle, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL OR HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the dreamer spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Dreamer table shows when you learn more dreamer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the dreamer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the dreamer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your dreamer spells. Your magic is derived from your link to the dream-like Feywild. You use your Intelligence whenever a dreamer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dreamer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
            <p>You can cast a dreamer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>

You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>

Dedicated to the mystical and arcane nature of the Feywild, they learn to enhance and augment their own dreams while manipulating the dreams of others. Those who become dream weavers typically respect the tenents and laws of nature. Some are accused of having their heads in the clouds or preferring landscapes and items that are abstract or unique by nature. The shaping of dreams requires a flexible mind, which leads to incredible mystical powers.</p>

These fierce, etheral combatants combine their physical prowess with their mental. They can draw upon the mystical energies of the Feywild to deliver pain and confusion to their enemies. Dream warriors tend to be dextrous magic fighters, as difficult to catch as a dream. </p>
            <h4>EXPANDED SPELL LIST</h4>
            <p>The Unseelie lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a dreamer spell. The following spells are added to the dreamer spell list for you.</p>

            <p>You summon mystical energy that assumes the form of a vehicle of your choosing. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the vehicle takes on the form of a cart, chariot, carriage, rowboat, sled or wagon. The vehicle can hold up to 6 medium creatures, including drivers, or 2500 pounds. The chariot can only hold 2 medium creatures, including 1 driver, or 750 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything in the vehicle falls to the ground. One large creature can replace 2 medium creatures and 2 small creatures can replace 1 medium creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">You decide if any creatures pull the vehicle, as well as the appearance of those creatures, up to a maximum of two. They are considered part of the conjured vehicle and can not be moved more than 30 feet from the vehicle itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">The vehicle has a speed of 40 feet and can travel 4 miles an hour, or 6 miles at a fast pace. The vehicle has an AC 12 and hit points equal to 5 times your proficiency bonus. When the spell ends, the vehicle gradually fades, giving riders 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the vehicle drops to 0 hit points. Once lost, hit points can not be recovered by any means.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the vehicle can grow to accomodate 1 additional medium creature or 500 pounds for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Land of the Seelie</b> - Titania, the Summer Queen, transforms your surroundings into the scene of your greatest deed. Those who fail their Intelligence saving throw are charmed by you until the end of your next turn.</li>
                <li><b>Forests of the Unseelie</b> - The Queen of Air and Darkness transforms your surroundings into the wild forests of the Feywild. Twisting vines and dense underbrush make movement nigh impossible. Those who fail their Intelligence saving throw are restrained until the end of your next turn.</li>
                <li><b>Mists of the Shadowfell</b> - Shar, Mistress of the Night, transforms your surroundings into a twisted land of mist and weaving shadows. Those who fail their Intelligence saving throw are frightened until the end of your next turn.</li>
