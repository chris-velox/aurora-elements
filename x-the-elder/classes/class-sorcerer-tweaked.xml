        <description>
            <p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p>
            <p class="indent">Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.</p>
            <p class="indent">Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.</p>
            <h5>INNATE MAGIC</h5>
            <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>
            <p class="indent">The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparant flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, wile others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power.</p>
            <h5>UNEXPLAINED POWERS</h5>
            <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.</p>
            <h5>CREATING A SORCERER</h5>
            <p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origin that ties to an array of varied species - but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with innate magic but perhaps scarred as well?</p>
            <p class="indent">How do you feel about the power coursing through you? Do you embrace it and master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for a lofty purpose, or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from others. Maybe your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this.</p>

            <description>
                <p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either spell slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Charimsa is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Spell Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li>
                    <li><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>SELF FOCUS</h5>
                <p>When you cast spells that require a material component, you can ignore that component unless it has a value, such as the specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp for the augury spell, in which case the components are required.</p>

            <p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors.

Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.</p>

            <p>The gods are beings of immense power, but yet, they are distant, refraining from directly meddling in the affairs of mortals. Instead, they invest mortal agents with their powers to carry out their will upon the material plane. A Godtouched is one such agent, imbued with divine power by the gods to complete a specific quest. You might have been godtouched at birth, or through some divine revelation later in life. Your magic is divine, your very being carrying a spark of the gods’ own power within it. Unlike other agents of the gods, you require no faith and no ritual to channel their might.</p>
            <p class="indent">The gods have vested you with a purpose, a fate, a destiny to fulfill. It may be a legendary prophecy, or an enigmatic quest that you yourself do not know the extent of. You may receive celestial visions or messages concerning your destiny, and dark forces are almost assuredly working to stop it.</p>

Many with this power can trace their magic back to a near-death experience caused by the Great Rain, but perhaps you were born during a howling gale so powerful that folk still tell stories of it, or your lineage might include the influence of potent air creatures such as vaati or djinn. Whatever the case, the magic of the storm permeates your being.</p>

            <p>An old legend speaks of an ancient queen so hard-hearted and cold that her very heart turned to ice, her touch was frigid, and her mind as unstoppable as a glacier. Her beautiful and terrible power has come to fruition within you. Perhaps you came in contact with a magical relic from the deep north that once belonged to her, or you are a long forsaken descendant of this old monarch. Will you one day take up the throne of the old queen? Or does it mean nothing to you, and you’ll forge your own path of ambition?</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of your destiny, wintry ascendants are cold in both soul and body. Consider how this has been beneficial or detrimental to your relationships in the past and how it may yet affect you. It could lead to having stilted relations with others, or pragmatic, business-like ones.</p>

You may have inherited this bloodline directly from a vampire in your family, or perhaps you survived a near-death attack by a vampire, or were a thrall to a vampire for a time. You may reject your inner vampirism, attempting to abstain from blood and hiding the source of your power, or perhaps you embrace these powers, and seek to drain the blood of your foes on a quest to become a true vampire.</p>

            <p>Your innate magic comes from infernal power that can be traced back to the Nine Hells of Baator, power infused into your blood or that of your ancestors. Such power most often manifests itself as the result of a pact or bargain made with a powerful devil, such as a Pit Fiend or an Erinyes. You may have endured a near death experience at the hands of a devil and been forever tainted by the encounter, or perhaps your bloodline includes a powerful Tiefling whose ancestry has manifested in an unusual way. Regardless of circumstance, fell power now surges through you, both a blessing and a curse.</p>

Your innate magic stems from the chaotic, churning energies of this plane, a terrible force that grants you great capacity for destruction and corruption. Some sorcerers of this origin can trace their powers back to extensive exposure to Abyssal corruption, or perhaps due to influence on their lineage from demonic forces, while others may have wrested their capabilities from a subdued demon in a dark ritual, tearing away its power and infusing it into themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">No matter the method of acquisition, those who wield the powers of Abyss tread a dangerous path, for their very blood yearns to be used in pursuit of devastation. A strong will is required to keep these compulsions in check, and those who succumb to them can be just as cruel and malevolent as a demon - or worse.</p>

                <p>At 18th level, you have attained true mastery over your demonic blood and can rend wide reality itself, creating a gateway to the chaotic and destructive forces of the Abyss. As an action, you can spend 6 sorcery points to tear open an abyssal breach in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you, which persists for 1 hour or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). Each creature within 30 feet of the breach as it opens must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw whenever it comes within 30 feet of the breach or starts its turn there.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you maintain concentration on the breach for its whole duration, it stabilizes, no longer dealing damage and becoming dormant for 1 month, when it can be closed by dispel magic cast at 5th level or above or if you use your action to do so. After 1 month, it becomes a 10 feet tall, 10 feet wide stable portal, serving as a gateway between a random layer of the Abyss (determined by the DM) and the plane on which this feature was originally used. The presence of such a breach is anathema to natural life, killing and withering all plants within a mile radius. The breach remains until a month passes, you die, you create another stabilized breach, or it is forcibly closed by the will of a demon lord, dispel magic cast at 9th level, or similarly powerful effects.</p>

The martial prowess infused in its halls, battlefields and peoples has been inherited by you. You may have been blessed by the spirit of a mighty warrior, or been touched by the energies of Ysgard in the aftermath of a great battle. No matter the cause, your warlike magic makes you adept in all theatres of battle and drives you on to ever more grand and dangerous challenge.</p>

They linger and obey your verbal commands (no action required) for 1 minute, until you lose concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell) or they die. If you don’t issue a command to the spirits, they attack the most dangerous hostile creature they can see. Once you’ve summoned these spirits, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Your power draws from the immortal flame that fuels the legendary phoenix. You or your ancestors perhaps rendered a phoenix a great service, or you were born in its presence. Whatever the cause, a shard of the phoenix’s power dwells within you.</p>
            <p class="indent">That power is a mixed blessing. Like the mythical creature, you can invoke fiery energy and gain the ability to cheat death itself. This power is costly. The fire within you seethes, demanding to be unleashed. You sometimes find yourself absentmindedly feeding fires. You can’t bear to allow a fire to sputter out. You feel most comfortable while holding a torch or sitting near a campfire.</p>
            <p class="indent">Such sorcerers are wanderers by necessity. The volatile nature of their magic makes other folk nervous. If a fire breaks out in town, a phoenix sorcerer had best flee, whether guilty or not. Fire is a dangerous force, and phoenix sorcerers have a reputation (deserved or not) for reckless behavior, confident that the essence of the phoenix can save them.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You are an astral ghost. You are a spirit that is cyclical in its journey of life and death: life is not a line, but a cyclical hierarchy, ever moving forwards and upwards to come round again. Who can say if your soul is native to the astral plane or the material? Who can say if you are a ’real’ person, or a symptom of a mistake, one small error on the part of the gods, that let a soul escape the standard cosmological path and wander forever?</p>
            <p class="indent">An astral ghost dies, moves on to the Astral Plane, and after some time is reborn into new flesh in the world. Only when an astral ghost gives up the worldly life and is content to live within the Astral, thus unable to be resurrected back, do they once again remember fully their past lives, their complete self (even if miniscule parts did slip through the cracks previously). Such is their tragedy - or their privilege - for what is the life of an immortal soul if it can’t experience new life?</p>
            <p class="indent">Consider if your character knows the details of their origin. Have you met another astral ghost? Are there any other astral ghosts in the world - would you be privy to such knowledge? It’s likely your character doesn’t know the cyclical nature of their soul, but may have an astral facet that betrays the essence of their magical nature. If you wish, you can roll on or select from the table below to determine an astral facet.</p>

            <p class="indent">At the start of your next turn, the pillars fall to the ground. If a pillar falls onto a Medium or smaller creature, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d6 cold and 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the ground. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and must move 5 feet in any horizontal direction or fail the save automatically. A restrained creature who could move 5 feet can make a Strength or Dexterity check (their choice) as an action against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must move from under the pillar.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the pillars fall, you can use your bonus action to cause one or more of the pillars to shatter. Each creature within 5 feet of the shattered pillar must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 cold and 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. After the damage is dealt, a creature restrained by the pillar is no longer restrained.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its full duration, the pillars become permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, they fade when the spell ends.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You don a crown of ice, marking your connection to an ancient ice monarch. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets you with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their speed is reduced to 0 and they become prone before they make their attack or cast the spell, and you gain advantage on any saving throw you must make against the attack or spell. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw against this spell, they are immune to it for its duration.</p>

            <p>You send out a blast of dark chaos energy in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d4 necrotic damage and 2d4 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            <p>You momentarily heighten a creature’s sense of pain. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage the next time it takes damage before the spell ends. If the triggering damage is psychic damage, it instead takes 1d12 psychic damage.</p>
