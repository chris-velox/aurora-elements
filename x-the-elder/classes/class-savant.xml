        <description>
            <p>The slender elf cleans his glasses with the corner of his cloak as the dust settles around him. He was the first person to set foot in this ancient temple in hundreds of years. His benefactor had paid him a great deal to find this place, and after months of pouring over forgotten tomes he had finally figured out it’s long lost location. Now he had a choice to make, would he report back to his benefactor so they could strip the temple of it’s valuables? Or would he keep it’s location hidden, and preserve the knowledge found here himself? For to a savant, knowledge is more precious than gold coins.</p>
            <p class="indent">The elderly warrior assessed the state of his men, they were exhausted and almost out of supplies. This was the tenth day of the siege, and the warrior knew at this point no relief was coming. He was too old to be of use in battle, but if his men followed his orders to the letter, and without hesitation, they just might still have a fighting chance. He stood up, and for what may be the last time, drew his sword.</p>
            <p class="indent">A young dwarf bends over his unconscious comrade in the midst of battle, his hands shaking as he examines the unconscious dwarf’s wounds. His clan had spent a great deal of their fortune to send him to the best university gold could buy. All those hours spent in lectures, libraries, and observation; all for this moment. He thought back to what he had learned about field medicine from his professors and began to dress the dwarf’s wounds.</p>
            <h4>GREAT MINDS</h4>
            <p>There are many intelligent people in the world, but few are true savants. Born with with an innate desire to learn all they can, and the potential for a genius level intellect, they spend their lives studying anything that those around them are willing to teach them. Savants are often recognized at an early age, and in their hunger for knowledge, they are drawn to great libraries and universities. They will do anything to access the troves of knowledge that lie in hidden in forbidden places, for savants, no price is too steep to pay for knowledge.</p>
            <p class="indent">Despite their aptitude for learning, most savants seek to better themselves without having to rely on others. Savants reject the patronage of gods and other powerful beings, and in turn they view wizardry as a path for the weak willed. Relying on their great minds alone, they strive for perfection.</p>
            <h4>INTENSE SPECIALIZATION</h4>
            <p>Savants tend to be hyper focused on their chosen area of expertise. They obsess over it, learning all they can about the subject. Once they reach the climax of learning in that specialty and there is nothing anyone else can teach them, they do not move on. Instead they will go to great lengths, risking life and limb, to advance their chosen field of study.</p>
            <p class="indent">Often doing so at great cost to themselves, savants will not stop researching, experimenting, and theorizing until they have made an indelible mark in their academic discipline. A savants ultimate goal in life is to discover some previously unknown truth about the universe.</p>

As an action on your turn, expend an Intellect Point and force a creature within 30 ft., that can hear to you, to make an Intelligence saving throw against your Intellect save DC. On a failure, they become confused and distracted, and the next attack to target that creature before the beginning of your next turn has advantage.</p>

For each Intellect Point you expend, you can target one additional creature as long as they are within 30 ft., and can hear you.</p>

            <p>For all of history, there have been those who study how living things work. Clerics and priests of gods of life and healing, necromancers and liches who seek to raise the dead, and deadly assassins and warriors who learn the most vulnerable points to strike. Unlike all of these, the Physicians of the world use knowledge and mundane science to heal wounds, cure disease, and improve the quality of life for those that cannot afford the luxury of magical healing.</p>
            <p class="indent">Physicians are specialists who have focused their research on the body. Primarily, how it functions and how to repair it when damaged. Physicians do not rely on divine or arcane magic to heal, but through a combination of knowledge, focus, and precision they dress wounds, perform surgeries, and save lives.</p>
