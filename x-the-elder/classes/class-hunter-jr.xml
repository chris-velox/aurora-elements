            <p></p>
            <p>The foliage moves, and an arrow flies from its shadows, striking an orc in an unprotected chink in its crude armor. It falls, and its brothers turn and charge in the direction of the attack, screaming a war cry. The brush erupts again, but this time an elf covered in leafs springs from its midst, drawing swords and gracefully singing its own battle cry.</p>
            <p class="indent">A lion nudges the corpse of an elk, searching for savory flesh. A snap and a crack echoes amongst the forest, and the lion roars in anger and pain. As it tries to escape the trap that has bound it, a shadow descends on it with a slash, falling from the branches above. Silence swiftly follows.</p>
            <p class="indent">A werewolf bursts through the door of a small residency, and the inhabitants jump in fear. The wolf man falls and tumbles forwards, slamming into a table, its objects clanging loudly to the ground. From behind it a menacing figure in a torn cloak steps in through the doorway nimbly. Its bloodstained features illuminated by a longsword it wields brimming with radiant energy. The family stare at the figure now standing within their home towering above the dying lycanthrope with fear in their eyes. For the mans aura of hatred burns brighter than the light of his sword.</p>
            <h4>KEEN COMBATANTS</h4>
            <p>Observant and keen. These are the qualities of a hunter. Some hunters choose to ambush their prey, while others take pride in challenging them head on, finding confidence they can defeat their foe with other research and preparations they have made before hand. You may come across a hunter fighting along side a fearsome beast, shooting its prey from a far distance, or even grappling its prey before driving a blade into its temple. Regardless of method, all hunt with their eyes wide open, and are masters of finding, researching, and then exploiting the weaknesses of their foes.</p>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">A note on balance</h5>
                <p>Some features of this class such as creating traps, are designed to reward creativity. As a result of this, they also heavily hinge on how benevolent your DM is. It is important to check with your DM before playing this class to make sure that he/she understands these features and will attempt to work with you to utilize them when applicable. If the DM expresses that with the campaign they wish to run the trapping feature will sparsely be able to be used, this is better to know now than later.</p>

                <p>Starting at 1st level, when you see a creature, or find its tracks, markings, and other clues of its presence, you can choose to mark the creature as your prey. Doing so allows you to expend a bonus action or action to make a Wisdom (survival, medicine, or nature) check to discern more information about your chosen prey.</p>
                <p class="indent">The DC = 10 + the creatures CR (or the creatures level), subtracted by the levels you have in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you cannot see the creature you have disadvantage on this check. Tell the DM how this DC is generated, then roll. The DM instructs you which result you receive on the following table according to your roll.</p>

            <thead>
                <tr><td>Result</td><td>Effect</td></tr>

            <tr><td><b>5 or more above the DC.</b></td><td>You gain all of the lower effects. You learn the name of this type of creature along with its damage vulnerabilities. You learn the level of their highest level spell slot.</td></tr>
            <tr><td><b>10 or more above the DC.</b></td><td>You gain all of the lower effects. You critically hit this prey on a result of a 19-20 on a d20.</td></tr>

                <p class="indent">You can only use this feature against the same prey once every long rest. You can have multiple different prey at the same time. Once you take a long rest, any benefits you gain against your prey are lost and you must use this feature against the creature again to gain any of its benefits.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you have had a result equal to or greater than the DC against a creature in the past, whenever you get a On the Hunt check result lower than the DC against creatures of the same type and same CR (if it is a humanoid then also of the same faction), you can treat the result as if it was equal to the DC instead.</p>

                <p>At 2nd level, attacks against your prey gain potent benefits.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can steady yourself in combat to target your preys weaknesses with careful aim. When making a weapon attack, if you have not expended any of your movement on your turn, you can choose to not expend any of your movement for the remainder of your turn. This allows you to add your Weak Spot damage (as displayed on the Hunter class table) as extra damage on this attack and all other weapon attacks you make against your prey for the rest of the round. Whenever you deal Weak Spot damage as the result of using a bonus action or reaction you must half the amount of Weak Spot damage dice you roll (rounded down, to a minimum of 1).</li>
                    <li>You can mutilate your prey when striking them accurately. If you hit an enemy with advantage or disadvantage, and both rolls would have hit, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failure you can select one of their attack options you have seen them use. They suffer disadvantage on attack rolls with the attack option until the beginning of your next turn, as you mutilate the body part needed to use it.</li>

                <description>When making a weapon attack, if you have not expended any of your movement on your turn, you can choose to not expend any of your movement for the remainder of your turn to deal {{weak-spot:damage-dice}}d4 extra damage (half the dice if done as a bonus action or reaction. Minimum 1). If you hit an enemy with advantage or disadvantage, and both rolls would have hit, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC={{hunter:save-dc}}). On a failure you can select one of their attack options you have seen them use. They suffer disadvantage on attack rolls with the attack option until the beginning of your next turn.</description>

                <p class="indent">To create a trap, consult pgs 113 to 117 of Xanthars Guide to Everything. You must have an amount of levels in this class within the traps level range to be able to craft it.</p>

                <p class="indent">The DM decides how much time it takes to make your trap and what resources you will need to craft it. In order to craft the trap, make a survival check with the DC set by your DM dependent upon how complex your trap is.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, a player could wish to craft a bear trap. The DM decides that the player will need some scrap iron, and that it will take 20 minutes to craft. The DM decides that to create the bear trap the DC for the survival check to craft it will be 10, and that if the player succeeds, the trap will deal 1d10 piercing damage. The DM also decides that a creature hit by the trap will have its speed reduced to 0 and cant move until it succeeds a Strength check against the players trap DC to free itself. This trap, like all traps will only effect creatures within reason. For example it will not reduce the speed of a giant creature to 0.</p>

This allows you to instead inflict the target with the hemorrhaging condition. Whenever you inflicted the hemorrhaging condition on a creature you can choose one ability. The creature has disadvantage on all ability checks made with the ability until the condition is removed. When you or an ally within 30ft of you makes a weapon attack against a hemorrhaging target, you can expend your reaction to grant them advantage on the attack roll.</description>

                    <p>Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a companion that accompanies you and fights alongside you it battle. Choose a beast no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (appendix D of the players handbook presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beasts AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or 5x your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The companion obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move, and can command it to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action (no action required by you). If you use your action to do this, you can command it to attack a target. It will continue to attack the target without requiring your action on following turns until the target dies or falls unconscious. If you do not issue a command to your companion the DM decides what it does. Once you gain the Extra Attack feature, when taking the attack action you can instead give up one attack to command your companion to take the attack action.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The Companion never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If the your companion dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 1 hour magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.</p>

                <p>Blood Hunters are mysterious and frightening. They study occult arts and rituals in order to eliminate their prey, causing many hunters to distrust them. They guard their secret hunting methods closely, but will exploit them often, taking steep sacrifices when necessary to slaughter their prey. This is no better exemplified than by the dangerous ritual all blood hunters undergo to transmute and mutate themselves. Once completed this allows them to harness their own life force as a weapon in combat, but also often leaves them with scars and blemishes. Some appearing almost untouched, while others gaining a new eye color or disfigured complexion.</p>

                    <p>At 3rd level, the thrill of battle fuels your maneuvers.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Adrenaline Points.</b> You can gain adrenaline points during battle and can then expend them to perform Tricks. A trick’s adrenaline point cost is found in brackets before its name.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Doing the following grants you 1 adrenaline point:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p class="indent">At the beginning of your turn, if you did not gain any adrenaline points on your previous turn, you lose all of your adrenaline points.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Saving Throws.</b> Some of your tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Trick save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.</p>

                    <p>You can attempt the following tricks at 3rd level.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(0) Flourish.</b> When making a weapon attack, you can suffer disadvantage on the attack (if you had advantage then these cancel each other out). You can add your Wisdom modifier to the damage of this attack.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(1) Trick Attack.</b> Once per turn when rolling damage with a weapon attack, any time a Weak Spot damage dice rolls a result of 4 you gain 1 adrenaline point.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(1) Relent.</b> When you are rolling a weapon attack with disadvantage, you can re roll the lower dice once. You can only use this trick once per attack.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(1) Feint.</b> As a bonus action, force a creature you can see within 10ft of you to make a Wisdom save. On a failure you gain advantage on your next attack against them this turn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(1) Duck and Weave.</b> As a bonus action, grant yourself +1 AC, and whenever you roll, slide, or vault 10ft without expending your movement, you instead move 15ft. You gain these effects until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(2) Flow.</b> Expending your movement does not stop you from dealing your Weak Spot damage this round.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(2) Ricochet.</b> When making a ranged weapon attack, you can target a creature not visible to you. They gain the benefits of 3/4 cover, and you suffer disadvantage on the attack roll, as you ricochet the attack off an object at them.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(2) Ram.</b> When dealing Weak Spot damage to a target with a melee attack, for every consecutive 10ft you moved in a line this turn towards the target directly before making the attack, the target takes 1 additional Weak Spot damage dice.</p>

                    <p>At 7th level, you gain access to more complex tricks that require a higher amount of skill to pull off.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(2) Piercing Trick.</b> Once per attack when rolling your Weak Spot damage dice you can re roll any results of 1 and must use the new rolls, even if they roll a result of 1.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(3) Blinding Potion.</b> As an action you can throw a potion you have concocted at a point you can see within 30ft of you and shoot it or simply let it fall to the ground. All creatures within 10ft radius sphere centered on that point must succeed a dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 force damage + your Weak Spot damage and are blinded until the beginning of your next turn. On a successful save they take half damage.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(5) Lightning Trick.</b> You can cast the spell lightning arrow as a bonus action.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(6) Volley.</b> As an action, you can cast the spell conjure volley.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(7) Slashing Wind.</b> As an action, you can cast the spell steel wind strike. When casting the spell in this way, instead of making melee spell attacks you make melee weapon attacks, and the spells damage replaces the damage for these weapon attacks.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(7) Show Stopper.</b> As an action or bonus action, you can throw an explosive potion you have concocted in the air and shoot it or simply let it fall to the ground. All creatures within 20ft radius sphere originating from the potion must succeed a Dexterity saving throw or take 5d8 bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage (your choice) + your Weak Spot damage and are blinded until the beginning of your next turn. Creatures take half damage on a successful save. If you used your bonus action for this trick you must also make the save. You cannot be blinded by this trick.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>(10) Adrenaline Rush.</b> As a bonus action, you gain the effects of the spell haste for 1 minute.</p>

                <p>If you would like to procure the dilapidated head of a Mage, hire a Mage Hunter. Mage Hunters specialize in debilitating and slaying spellcasters with the use of their own nulifying magic. They generally use their arcane powers to fuel their weapons and speed, allowing them to close the gap between themselves and their foe, making sure their prey cannot flee, by both physical and arcane means. To the gleeful benefit of many Mage Hunters wallets, their are even occurances where Warlocks and Wizards will hire Mage Hunters to protect themselves from other Mage Hunters.</p>

                    <p>Starting at 3rd level, you have learned to cast spells, much as your prey do. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Mage Hunter spell list.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots</b> The Mage Hunter table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Mage Hunter spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal absorb elements and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast absorb elements using either slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b> You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Mage Hunter spell list.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Mage Hunter table shows when you learn more Mage Hunter spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Mage Hunter spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Mage Hunter spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability</b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your mage hunter spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to the arcane. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a mage hunter spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

                    <p>Additionally at 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with a bonus action or object interaction. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two. Additionally, you can use your Wisdom modifier for attack and damage rolls with the weapons, and whenever a hunter feature allows you to add your Wisdom modifier to an attack or damage roll, you can instead choose to add your Dexterity or Strength modifier (your choice).</p>
                    <p class="indent">Alternatively, in place of one of these weapons, you can attune yourself to a shield to protect both your body and mind, doing so allows you to add the shields AC to saving throws you make against spell effects. Lastly, choosing a thrown weapon with this feature allows you to instead choose up to 5 thrown weapons and count them as one weapon bond.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Whenever you hit an enemy with a weapon attack, for every 10ft you have moved directly before the attack in a straight line towards the enemy (this includes teleporting, falling, and flying), they suffer an additional 1d4 force damage, to a maximum of 10d4.</li>
                        <li>Whenever you roll, slide, or vault 10ft without expending any of your movement, you can expend a spell slot to teleport 10ft before, during, or after, moving in this way. This benefit lasts for 1 minute per level of the spell slot used.</li>
                        <li>Whenever you disable or remove an enemies attack option, you can instead choose to remove some of their spell slots. You can remove a number of spell slots equal to your proficiency bonus. When removing a spell slot, for each level it is higher than first, the number of spell slots you can remove is reduced by one.</li>
                        <li>Once per turn when an enemy you can see within 30ft of you casts a spell, you can expend your reaction and a spell slot to teleport to a point within 5ft of them and/or make a weapon attack against them. If the attack hits they must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure they suffer disadvantage on any attack roll made as part of the spell, and creatures targeted with the spell have advantage on any saving throw against it. If you expend a spell slot of 4th level or higher you do not need to expend your reaction.</li>

                <p>Hunters of heresy, witch craft, necromancy, and other practitioners of evil, purifiers commonly work for religious institutions as inquisitors, exorcists, witch hunters, and vampire hunters. Armed with divine blessings, they cast purifying incantations to purge evil and protect the weak and righteous. Purifiers are known to even hunt down blood hunters, as they are stern and unforgiving towards those who use the dark arts instead of sacred rights to aid them during hunts. Purifiers take any vow they make to purify a creature as law, and once they have a mark, will go to the ends of the earth to cross it out.</p>

                    <p>Starting at 3rd level, you have learned to cast holy spells. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Purifier spell list.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b> The Purifier table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Purifier spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal absorb elements and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast absorb elements using either slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Spells Known of 3rd Level and Higher You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Purifier spell list.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Purifier table shows when you learn more Purifier spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Purifier spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Mage Hunter spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Purifier spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to the arcane. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Purifier spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

                        <p>Humanoids are the main peoples of the D&amp;D world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.</p>

They commonly do this through stealth, out maneuvering their enemies, and then striking from advantageous positions.

Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, city, sea, or the Underdark.

                    <p>At 7th level, you revel in the rush of the hunt. Once per round, when you deal your Weak Spot damage, you can choose to gain half of the amount of damage your Weak Spot damage dealt as temporary hit points for 1 minute. While you have these temporary hit points, you gain advantage on Strength based checks and saving throws, and your carrying capacity (including your maximum load and maximum lift) doubles.</p>

                <p>Methodical planners and masters of ambush, trappers take pleasure in taking their time with trapping, and slaying their prey. Trappers see other sort of hunters as brash and dull, and take great pride when a successful hunt has come to a close without receiving a single scratch on their own hide. Trappers who work for coin are sought after as often for disarming traps as laying them, however if given a the choice a trapper will always accept the later.</p>

                    <p>Making traps is a creative process, and setting an ambush requires planning. It is important to make sure that making these traps and planning these ambushes does not slow the game down to a crawl. Think of trap ideas outside of the game session, and ask your DM about them outside of the game. Always try to get other players involved in making traps and ambush’s with you when possible.</p>

                    <p>Starting at 3rd level, you have learned to cast spells, much as those you hunt do. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the ranger spell list.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Spell Slots.</b> The Warden table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warden spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</b> You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the warden table shows when you learn more warden spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warden spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warden spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><b>Spellcasting Ability.</b> Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warden spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warden spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action or object interaction. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two. Additionally you can add half your Wisdom modifier (rounded down) to the attack and damage rolls with these weapons.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Alternatively, in place of one of these weapons, you can attune yourself to armor, doing so grants you proficiency in whatever armor you attune to, and allows you to summon it in the same way as your weapons. Lastly, choosing a thrown weapon with this feature allows you to instead choose up to 5 thrown weapons and count them as one weapon bond.</p>

                    <description>You can perform a 1 hour ritual to bond to one weapon (up to 2), a suit of armor, or 5 thrown weapons (counts as 1 weapon). If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</description>

                    <p>At 7th level, you excel at holding a defensive position, and ensuring your enemies cannot escape your methodical grasp.</p>

                        <li>If you choose to not expend any of your movement on your turn, you can take the Dodge action as a bonus action this turn as you brace yourself against oncoming attacks.

                        <li>Whenever you disable or remove an enemies attack option, you can also choose to reduce their movement speed to 0 until the end of your next turn.</li>
                        <li>At the end of your turn, if you have not expended any of your movement, you can roll your Weak Spot dice and gain the result as temporary hit points until the end of your next turn. You can expend one spell slot to increase this duration to 1 minute per level of the spell slot used.</li>

                    <p>Finally, at 15th level, you have learned how to consolidate more layers of defense. Whenever you receive temporary hit points while you already have temporary hit points, instead of being forced to choose one or the other, you can choose to add these temporary hit points to your current temporary hit points. Doing so however weighs you down, and each time you do this, your movement speed is reduced 5ft until your temporary hit points are lost or reduced to 0.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Additionally, as an action you can reduce your temporary hit points to 0, causing them to strike out from you as roots, thorns, or another form you choose. Enemies within 20ft of you must succeed a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take an amount of damage equal to half of the temporary hit points you expended and are pushed back 15ft and knocked prone. This is dealt as piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage (your choice) and is treated as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities. They take half damage on a successful save.</p>
