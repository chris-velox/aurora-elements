            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Esoteric Implement.</em></strong> A keeper’s implement says a great deal about the persona they project to the world. A keeper with a chalice might hoard power, saving their strength for a crucial moment, while a keeper with a sceptre might be the opposite, bold, brilliant, dramatic, readily making proud claims and challenges.</p>
            <p class="indent">A keeper can use an esoteric implement as a spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook. To use the implement in this way, the caster must hold it in hand or wear it visibly.</p>

            <p>Once, these concord scrolls were sworn by knights in protection of their liege, the magic infused into the contract empowering the signee even as it bound them. The magic, now dimmed, no longer possesses the grip over the signee’s will it once did; its boon, however, remains.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can present this concord to another, offering its power. If the creature accepts the concord, it gains a bonus to the attack and damage rolls of its weapon or spell attacks (your choice). The bonus is determined by its rarity. If the creature already has a bonus to its weapon or spell attacks from a magic item, use whichever bonus is higher.</p>
            <p class="indent">This bonus lasts until the concord is destroyed, its power is used again, or the signee attacks the creature that presented the concord to them.</p>
