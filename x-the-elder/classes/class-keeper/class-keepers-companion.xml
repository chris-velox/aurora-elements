        <description>
            <p>Starting at 1st level, the binding placed upon your companion grounds it in reality, tying it to the material world. This more physical presence grants it a number of benefits.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion obeys your commands as best it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion’s anchoring in this world is fledgling. As a result, it can’t attack until you reach 3rd level in this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion has features and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion gains no benefit from armour or weapons, whether or not it is physically capable of using them. Your companion has a natural armour class of 12 + your proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each keeper level after 1st, your companion gains an additional Hit Die and increases its hit points accordingly. Your companion’s Hit Dice are d8s, regardless of its size. When your companion is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as a player character would.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion’s level is equal to your keeper level for the purpose of spells and features like <em>polymorph</em> and <em>true polymorph</em>.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion’s abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</p>
            <p class="indent">You decide your companion’s alignment and ideal. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the the tables below to determine its traits and flaws. Its bond is always "I must protect my keeper. We are greater together than alone."</p>
            <h5>CREATING A COMPANION</h5>
            <p>You use the rules presented here when creating your companion.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion is a Small or Medium creature (your choice). If mounted, it continues to act independently, not as a controlled mount.</p>
            <p class="indent">You generate your companion’s abilty scores using the following numbers: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8. You assign each of these numbers to an ability score of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion can be one of many creature types. Select one of the following types: aberration, beast, celestial, construct, dragon, elemental, fey, fiend, giant, monstrosity, ooze, plant, or undead.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion is proficient in Charisma saving throws. Additionally, choose one ability score other than Charisma. Your companion gains proficiency in saving throws using the chosen ability.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your companion is proficient in two skills of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">Finally, select two traits from the following list to give your companion a feeling uniquely its own. Choose carefully. Once created, your companion’s features cannot be changed.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an keeper’s companion, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per keeper’s companion level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per keeper’s companion level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Charisma, one of your choice</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose any two skills.</li>
