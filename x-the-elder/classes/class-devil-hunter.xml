        <description>
            <p>A tiefling warrior smirks as he steps onto the battlefield, gripping his crossbow and blade. He lets out a smug laugh as he dives into the crowd of fiends. Before they even have a chance to react, he sweeps through their numbers, quickly swapping through his large arsenal of blades and bows. With one final smirk, the man’s body transforms, becoming as fiendish as the creatures around him. He thrusts his greatsword into the crowd, tearing through all their bodies, leaving naught but shadows in his wake.</p>
            <p class="indent">Amidst a blood soaked battlefield, a half-elf duelist plants his longsword into the ground, rotating the hilt as it revs with fiery energy. He laughs triumphantly as he thrusts his right arm outward, projecting a large spectral arm which drags his opponent toward him. With a quick transformation into a fiendish form and a brutal swing of his blade, the half-elf explosively cleaves his foe in half.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human stands alone, perusing the contents of a book. With a twirl of his cane and a flip of the page, nightmarish fiends manifest before him. Graceful as a conductor, he directs them in graceful harmony, obliterating the straw target in front of him. As he calmly closes the book, the fiends vanish, ready to called upon again at a moment’s notice.</p>
            <p class="indent">With equal parts style, brutality, and poise, the devil hunter moves like a bat out of hell to cleave the battlefield in twain. A variety of armaments, maneuvers, and allies serve these awe-inspiring hunters to transform life-or-death engagements into their own personal entertainment. Though they come in many forms, devil hunters are all tenacious warriors who share a common goal and will dive into the darkest depths in their quest to exterminate the minions of the Underworld. Fiends of all kinds beware—these slayers are packing devilish power fearsome enough to make even the devil cry.</p>
            <h4>BIRTHRIGHT OF FIENDS</h4>
            <p>Though they are called devil hunters, their quarry is not limited to fiends. Rather, devil hunters derive their name from powers from their ties to devils and demons alike. Some are the descendants of such fiends, while other may have been affected by fiends in more mysterious ways. The touch of demon, a deal gone wrong with a devil, or a haphazard journey to the Abyss may have awakened the fiend inside.</p>
            <p class="indent">Though light on their feet and quick with their blades, the bloodline of fiends makes devil hunters incredibly resilient, among other benefits. By learning to harness these fiendish powers and mastering their combat prowess, they discover and perfect new ways of unleashing fury on the battlefield.</p>
            <h4>MASTERS OF STYLE</h4>
            <p>For a devil hunter, the mastery of style is of utmost importance. Style is the lifeblood of combat for devil hunters, keeping their fights entertaining, but also graceful and light. Devil hunters harness this power to create fiendish effects and perform beyond their bodies’ capabilities. As they gain experience, their flair and elegance allows them to sweep through their foes, leaving only a show for those to watch.</p>
            <h4>FLIPPANT AND FEARLESS</h4>
            <p>Devil hunters are never without quips, especially in the face of danger. They enjoy showing off and taunting their foes as often as possible. Whether to entertain themselves, or provoke openings, devil hunters revel in the art of provocation.</p>
            <h5>FIGHTING PHILOSOPHIES</h5>
            <p>All devil hunters have their own personal styles of combat, despite sharing in their desires for stylish action. Such styles reflect their battle philosophies and how they carry themselves in a fight.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">Fighting Philosophies</h5>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Philosophies</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>You have an aloof style of combat, heading straight into the face of danger with a devil-may-care attitude.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You take combat with a serious attitude, seeking to crush your foes with whatever it takes.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>You face combat with a calm and strategic manner, even reciting poetry as you decimate your opponents.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Might controls everything, and without strength you cannot protect anything, let alone yourself.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>You are playful in combat and enjoy toying with your foes until they bore you.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You are fierce and tough in battle, showing no weaknesses or openings to friend and foe alike.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h4>CREATING A DEVIL HUNTER</h4>
            <p>As you make your devil hunter character, think about the origin of your power, and what that may entail. Are you a descendant of a legendary devil with a legacy to fulfill? Are you merely someone who had an unfortunate encounter with the Abyss? Or are you the product of your ancestor’s dealings with a devil?</p>
            <p class="indent">How do you feel about the fiendish power that resonates within you? Do you embrace it, or is it a mark of embarrassment? Is it a blessing or curse? Did you seek this power, or did it seek you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with your power? Was it given to you to protect others? Or to subjugate them?</p>
            <p class="indent">Equally important is why you fight. For a devil hunter, fights are sources of entertainment. Do you hold back to give your opponents a fair chance? Or do you unleash all that you have to see how long they may last? What kind of warrior are you motivated to be? Is there a certain person or creature that you are trying to defeat? Or do you seek a rival that can match your abilities? Consider how you might feel when faced with a foe beyond your abilities, and how you may feel after winning or losing against it.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a devil hunter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Charisma your highest ability score, following with Strength or Dexterity, depending on what kinds of weapons you would like to use. Second, take the Folk Hero background.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a fighting style from the list of optional features. You can’t take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
                <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second Attack.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 2nd level, your devilish power allows you to harness style and grace with every movement. Your ability to tap into style is represented by a number of style points. Your devil hunter level determines the number of points you have, as shown by the Style Points column of the Devil Hunter table.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various stylish features. You start knowing two such features: Stinger and Charged Shot. You learn more stylish features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you spend a style point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which your style is replenished anew.</p>
                <p class="indent">Some of your style features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Style Save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>DISTORTION</h5>
                <p>Your stylish features may use a Distortion die, a d4. This die changes as you gain devil hunter levels, as shown in the Distortion column of the Devil Hunter table.</p>
                <h5>STINGER</h5>
                <p>When you take the Attack action with a melee weapon that you are proficient with on your turn, you can spend 1 style point as a bonus action to move up to 30 feet in a straight line, stopping at the first creature you attack, adding necrotic damage equal to your Distortion die to the damage roll on a hit. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</p>
                <h5>CHARGED SHOT</h5>
                <p>When you take the Attack action with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with on your turn, you can spend 1 style point as a bonus action to infuse your ranged weapon with fiendish energy. You add your Distortion die to all attack rolls with that weapon and ignore the loading property until the end of your turn.</p>

                <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a manifestation of nightmares to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 style points to magically summon Shadow, a quadruped beast that can morph into weapons, to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. Shadow uses the dire wolf’s statistics (see the <em>Monster Manual</em> or appendix C in the <em>Player’s Handbook</em>), with the following changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shadow is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a fiend, not a beast.</li>
                    <li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your devil hunter level.</li>
                    <li>It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Shadow takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>
                    <li>At the start of its turn, Shadow automatically knows its target’s location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from Shadow.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">The Shadow appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the Shadow. On its turn, it can move only towards its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The Shadow can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. If the Shadow’s attack reduces a creature’s hit points below 1, the creature’s hit points become 1 and it becomes stunned until the end of the Shadow’s next turn. Additionally, while the Shadow is within 5 feet of the target, it can use its reaction to grant you advantage when you make an attack roll against the target. The Shadow disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</p>

                <p>At 11th level, you can use your action to magically summon an amorphous massive hulking demon from very nightmares themselves. Choose an unoccupied 10 foot cube that you can see within 60 feet. Nightmare appears at the point. Additionally, each creature within 5 feet of Nightmare must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
                <p class="indent">As part of that action, and on subsequent turns as an action while you are within 60 feet of Nightmare, you may activate Promotion, mounting Nightmare. While you are mounted on Nightmare, you are immune to all damage, but Nightmare is no longer immune to all damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">Nightmare’s attacks count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">Nightmare shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take one of the actions in its stat block or to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action.</p>
                <p class="indent">Nightmare lasts a number of turns equal to half your devil hunter level, and disappears early if it is reduced to 0 hit points or you die. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
