        <description>
            <p>The young halfling looms a half dozen stories over the city street beneath the glow of a bright full moon, her mistcloak fluttering quietly in the breeze. She eyes the guards that stand below, then launches into the sky like a thrown pebble. At the top of her arc she drops a coin to the ground then rockets back into the air high over the castle wall. A guard picks up the coin and then looks up to see naught but a fleeting shadow. He pockets the coin as he mumbles about his good luck.</p>
            <p class="indent">The commander gives a frustrated cry to seize the half-orc on the bridge. Her soldiers inch nervously onto the bridge at both ends. Surrounded, the half-orc spits before raising up both of his arms. The soldiers flinch, and then are flung backward as if pushed by some invisible force. The commander watches helplessly as a dozen soldiers plummet off the bridge.</p>
            <p class="indent">"Rise up! The time is now!", the rebel leader says atop his soap box. A listless crowd stands about him, never growing to more than a dozen. Among them stands a heavily tattooed man. A few start to raise their hands, muttering about high taxes, but then stop as they feel their anger subside. Wearing the slightest smile the tattooed man watches them go, thinking to himself, "There will be no rebellion this day."</p>
            <p class="indent">Mistborn use Allomancy, the art of pushing and pulling on oneself, metals, and other creatures. By drawing on power from within themselves, or "the mists" so people say, they can enhance their strength and reflexes to superhuman levels, push and pull on metals as if with powerful magnetic force, and even manipulate the emotions of other creatures.</p>
            <h4>AWAKENING</h4>
            <p>All mistborn awaken to their allomantic powers after near-death experiences, most commonly through severe physical trauma. Some awaken as a result of an accident, such as having fallen from a great height. Others awaken through severe mental and emotional anguish -- many mistborn origins can be traced to broken homes and abusive guardians.</p>
            <p class="indent">Those who awaken are said to have been "chosen by the mists", a divine invocation from a bygone time. They feel a well of power thrumming deep within their bodies, drawing upon it instinctively to fuel their allomantic abilities. With each passing moment a mistborn learns to draw more upon that well, enhancing and expanding their allomantic repertoire.</p>
            <h4>ALLOMANTIC ABILITIES</h4>
            <p>A mistborn’s power is the ability to push and pull. By pushing on on their own bodies, they can enhance their strength, speed, and balance. By pulling, they can heighten their senses. They can push and pull on metal, turning copper pieces into dangerous projectiles or moving themselves through the air as if yanked by a powerful rope. By pushing on others they can dampen emotions, or by pulling ignite them.</p>
            <p class="indent">These powers make mistborn highly sought after by the wealthy and politically powerful, and thus the subject of control and manipulation. Many mistborn adventure to avoid or escape these bonds, while others seek beyond freedom in pursuit of wealth and political power for themselves. Fewer among them decide that the "figure in the mists" they occasionally see is not a hallucination, but perhaps a lead to the true source of allomancy. Whatever their reasons, mistborn bring an untethered mobility and flexibility to any adventuring party, offering combative, exploration, and diplomatic capability for almost any need that arises.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A MISTBORN</h4>
            <p>When creating a mistborn, first think about what circumstances lead to your awakening. Were you seriously injured in an accident and then discovered you could move metals with your mind in your hospital bedroom? Were you groomed for the process by your guardians and ritually beaten alongside other children? Was your trauma so long ago that you do not recall it, yet have since always had a knack for making people act to your advantage?</p>
            <p class="indent">On whose behalf do you now use your abilities, yourself or another? Do you revel in the thrill of your powers, or do you soberly contemplate its utility?</p>
            <p class="indent">Do you see your powers as a means to an end, or its unfettered use an end in itself? Does great power come with great responsibility, or the absolute freedom to use it for your own ends? Do you wonder where your powers come from and seek out its origin, or is the past in the past and nothing to be trifled with?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>

                <p>A mistcloak is a charcoal grey cloak made up of hundreds of long, ribbon-like strips, sewn together at the shoulders and chest but flowing freely like streamers down to one’s ankles. In a bygone era, it helped hide mistborn in heavy mists and served as a signifier of status. It is constructed to come free when pulled, so that it cannot be used against a mistborn in combat.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Beginning at 1st level, you have awakened to and begun to hone your allomantic powers.</p>
                <h5>MISTING TALENTS</h5>
                <p>Your allomancy is manifested in various abilities, such as the pulling and pushing of metals and emotions. These abilities are called misting talents, and the kinds of misting talents you have access to increase as you gain levels. At 1st level, you have access to 3 misting talents: <em>Pewterarm</em>, <em>Steelpush</em>, and <em>Ironpull</em>.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING MISTING TALENTS AND ABILITIES</h5>
                <p>You prepare the list of misting talents that are available for you to use, choosing from the misting talent list. When you do so, choose 3 misting talents. You must meet the talent’s prerequisites before you can prepare it. There are two kinds of misting talents: allomantic powers, which serve as your foundational abilities, and everything else, which improve your allomantic powers. The number of misting talents you can prepare increases as you gain levels, as shown in the Mistborn table.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can also change your list of prepared talents when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of misting talents requires time spent in altering your body chemistry with alchemist’s supplies: at least 5 minutes for each misting talent on your list.</p>
                <h5>ALLOMANTIC ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Your allomantic ability modifier is +2 for your misting talents, since the potency of your allomancy depends on your time and experience as an allomancer as opposed to any inherent trait. You use your allomantic ability modifier when setting the save DC for any misting talent you use and when making an attack roll with one. Your allomantic ability modifier increases as you gain mistborn levels, as shown in the mistborn table.</p>
                <center>
                <p><strong>Allomantic save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Allomantic Ability modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Allomantic attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Allomantic Ability modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>USING ALLOMANCY</h5>
                <p>While some misting talents grant you passive benefits, like Pewter Defense, other misting talents interact with the world around you, such as Coinpush and Lurcher. If one of these talents requires you to target an object or creature, you use your Allomantic Range, as shown in the Mistborn table. If a talent refers to the weight of an object, it refers to its weight and the weight of anything it is attached to or is directly supporting it. Movement made via misting talents is considered forced movement. A creature moved via misting talents, including yourself, does not trigger opportunity attacks.</p>
                <p class="indent">You cannot push or pull on metal that is embedded in or inside creatures. For example, you cannot push against a pierced metal earring or the iron inside a person’s blood. You know where all metal is so long as they are within reasonable view. When metal is hidden from view, you can still act upon it with your talents.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your talents can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>
                <h5>ALLOMANTIC ATTACK AND DAMAGE</h5>
                <p>When you <em>steelpush</em> or <em>ironpull</em> a metal weighing less than 1 pound, such as a copper piece, you can instead move it a maximum distance equal to your allomantic range and you can make a ranged spell attack with it. When you do so, you target a creature in the line of that push or pull and add your allomantic attack modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, it deals 1d8 + your allomantic ability modifier piercing damage.</p>
                <center>
                <p><strong>Allomantic damage</strong> = 1d8 + your Allomantic Ability modifier piercing damage</p>
                </center>
                <p class="indent">When you use your <em>ironpull</em> or <em>steelpush</em> on an object that’s being carried, the creature can choose to let the object go instead of making a saving throw. If the creature is not easily separable from the metal, such as if it is wearing a suit of armor, then you instead push or pull the entire creature.</p>
                <div class="sidebar">
                    <h5 class="caption">Soothing and Rioting</h5>
                    <p>The allomantic powers of brasspush and zincpull do not let an allomancer know what a creature is feeling. A creature can be feeling an innumerable number of emotions at varying intensities at any given time. By pushing or pulling an emotion that is not already primed to be suppressed or ignited, a callous allomancer may rouse a target’s suspicions and expose their touch. Creatures aware of a person’s ability to manipulate emotions may become more wary and actively avoid them, so those who specialize in soothing and rioting tend to obscure their abilities for as long as possible.</p>

If when you <em>steelpush</em> or <em>ironpull</em> against a target whose weight exceeds your own and your size category is greater than your target’s, then you can choose to push or pull them instead of being pushed or pulled.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, say you are a medium-sized human. Steelpushing a heavier, medium-sized armored warrior in front of you would cause you to be pushed away from them. However, if you are anchored to an iron handle bolted into a stone wall behind you, your size would be considered large for the purposes of steelpushing and ironpulling, enabling you to <em>steelpush</em> the medium-sized heavier warrior away.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can drop an anchor at any time. To reestablish an anchor, you need to make a new <em>steelpush</em> or <em>ironpull</em>.</p>

            <h5 class="caption">ZINCPULL</h5>
            <p>As an Action, choose a creature other than yourself within your allomantic range. For as long as you maintain concentration, creatures gain advantage on charisma checks against the target that rely on the intensity of one of the following emotions plus an additional benefit tied to that emotion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Joy.</strong> You excite the target’s sense of happiness and wonder. It has disadvantage on saving throws against charm effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Anger.</strong> You ignite the target’s sense of irritation and displeasure. When it attacks, it cannot help but attack recklessly. It gains advantage on its first attack roll on each of its turns and grants advantage to the first attack roll made against it before the start of each of its turns.</li>
                <li><strong>Fear.</strong> You heighten the target’s sense of anxiety and danger. It has disadvantage on saving throws against fear effects.</li>

            <p>When a target suspects their emotions are being manipulated, or at the end of each of its turns in combat, it can make a Wisdom saving throw against your Allomantic save DC. On a success, it becomes aware of the manipulation’s source, can choose to end the ability’s effect on them, and can’t be the target of this ability again for the next hour or unless it allows it.</p>

            <p>Whenever you zincpull, or while you are zincpulling on a creature, you can choose to flare zinc.

            <p>When you activate your tinsense, or as a Bonus Action while your tinsense is active, you can choose to flare your tin. While flared, your darkvision range doubles, you add double your proficiency to Perception checks, and you can hear and focus on sounds clearly up to 300 ft. away through up to 6 inches of stone or 1 foot of wood. You also double the amount of additional damage you take from all types except psychic. Tin remains flared until the end of your next turn, or until you lose concentration, whichever comes first.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Any attacks against you miss, unless it’s a critical hit or you allow it to hit. Critical hits against you are treated as normal hits.</li>
                <li>When you would be made to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can first as a Reaction move up to half your speed, potentially causing you to no longer be targeted by the effect. If you have coinshot and/or lurcher prepared, you can steelpush or ironpull yourself instead.</li>
                <li>When you miss with an attack, you instead hit.</li>
