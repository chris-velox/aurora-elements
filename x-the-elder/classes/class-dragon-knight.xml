        <description>
            <p>A human clad in gleaming plate armour stares down a snarling owlbear, slowly reaching for the lance strapped across her back. The owlbear charges before she can reach her weapon, but a gout of fire from the sky stops the owlbear in its tracks. The gold dragon lands in front of the human, its eyes burning with a fiery vengeance as it snorts, causing flames to billow from its nostrils. Mounting her dragon, the human lets out a war cry as the dragon takes off into the air.</p>
            <p class="indent">Pulling the bowstring back, the elf whispers a few hushed words as an arcane fire erupts around the goblins below. Lightning sparks at the tip of his arrow, and he grins to himself as he fires at the goblin chief. The arrow finding its mark, the goblin chief can barely cry for help as lightning explodes from his body, arcing off to his nearby guards.</p>
            <p class="indent">Shouting a war cry, the dwarf waves his banner in the air, a wave of energy flowing over the battlefield as his allies, a human and a halfling, harass an ogre. The ogre, seeing the origin of this magic, stampedes towards the dwarf, but is quickly stopped as a dragon, its scales shining a brilliant bronze, spews lightning forth from its maw.</p>
            <p class="indent">Reaching her hand out, the halfling brushes the hair out of the eyes of the small boy who lies in the rubble of the collapsed building. A shield of divine magic wraps around his small frame as the halfling pulls him into her arms, carrying him to safety.</p>
            <p class="indent">Scowling to himself, the half-orc looks around the darkened cave for his quarry. Letting out a short whistle, a dark dragon, onyx in colour, seems to appear from the shadows with a dead drow in its maw. Rolling his eyes, the half-orc makes a motion with his hands, and the dragon spits out the drow, a sheepish expression on its reptilian face as a shadow begins to rise from the corpse.</p>
            <p class="indent">While different in personality and fighting styles, all of these heroes are dragon knights, a champion who fights alongside a dragon companion. Tough, relentless and unyielding, dragon knights and their dragons never give up, fighting to either heroic or devious ends.</p>
            <h4>AN UNBREAKABLE BOND</h4>
            <p>The bond between a dragon knight and their dragon is nearly impossible to eclipse. Only powerful magic can even attempt to turn them against one another, and they nearly never fight against their own will. Despite this, a knight and their dragon have been known to argue over strategy, tactics, or even miscellaneous things, as the dragon, despite its respect for its master, is not quick to let go of its ego.</p>
            <p class="indent">This connection has its drawbacks, however, and should the dragon knight fall in battle, the dragon too will die, as the dragon’s spirit simply can’t live without the knight. Should the dragon fall in battle, the knight can restore its body with a costly ritual, but a few knights instead choose to let their dragons rest, and go on to instead simply channel their dragon’s power.</p>
            <h4>PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT</h4>
            <p>All dragon knights are divided by their practices, and much like the dragons they raise and fight with, the knights are known to be proud at their best, and egotistical at their worst. Two people of different practices are rarely able to get along, despite how similar they might be. Those of the Platinum Practice always regard themselves superior to those of the Shadow Practice, and members of the Elemental Practice consider the members of the Rider Practice to be brutish and dim-witted. Those of the Valiant Practice seek to unite each dragon knight to work under the same banner, despite their strong differences.</p>
            <p class="indent">Despite these rivalries, dragon knights are fiercely loyal, and will never betray another dragon knight, even if they come from a different practice. Dragon knights believe they only have each other to count on, as no one else understands the intense bond between the knight and the dragon.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A DRAGON KNIGHT</h4>
            <p>When creating your dragon knight, there’s one question you should consider before all others; how did you get your dragon? Did you find an egg, and manage to form a bond with the hatchling? Was it a gift from an ancient dragon, looking for someone to protect its young? Did it declare you as its master one day, much to your suprise?</p>
            <p class="indent">All dragon knights go through the bonding ceremony, which is where they form a close bond with their dragon, establishing each other as allies and protectors. Was your dragon willing in this ceremony, or was it raised to serve you? Or did your dragon actually perform the ceremony, and you had absolutely no clue as to what was going on?</p>
            <p class="indent">Something else you must consider is your character’s martial abilities. All dragon knights are skilled in combat, and how your character is too is something that will need to be considered. Perhaps they where a student at a military academy, or a guard-in-training at their home village?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a dragon knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength your highest ability score. Your next highest ability score should be Constitution if you plan to focus on melee combat, or Charisma if you want to improve your overall subclass features. Second, choose the Soldier background.</p>
            <h4>COVENANT</h4>
            <p>Each dragon knight has a different story to tell when it comes to how they met their dragon. The way a dragon and knight first meet often set up how they interact for the rest of their lives, and a bad first impression can prove disasterous to their bond.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you consider the creation of this covenant, also consider the following: were you and your dragon both willing, and does your character ever regret the bond?</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Covenant</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Bonding with a dragon as you reach adulthood is all you’ve ever known, and is the way your ancestors have always lived.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You stumbled across your dragon in a forest, cave, or on the beach. Since then, it hasn’t stopped following you around.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Your dragon has always been with you for as long as you remember, and you can’t remember ever conducting a formal ritual.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>As a way of proving yourself, you went out into the wild to capture a dragon as proof of your strength and power.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Forced to bond with your dragon, it acts as a guardian and a protector, despite how much you insist you don’t need its help.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>Trading a large amount of treasure for a dragon’s egg, you raised the dragon to serve as your mount and companion.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h4>RELATIONSHIP</h4>
            <p>The nature of the relationship between dragon and knight varies between each dragon knight, and changes the way each knight and dragon interact with each other, and those around them. This relationship is based on their covenant, ideals, flaws, and personality traits.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you decide on your relationship, consider how it will effect the way you and your dragon fight together.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Relationship</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Best friends can’t even begin to describe you and your dragon, and you do absolutely everything together.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Your dragon is merely a tool to be used, and you like to frequently remind it of such.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Despite your differences and arguments, you and your dragon have come to respect each other, but your relationship is still rocky.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You and your dragon have both agreed to keep your relationship businesslike. All that matters is how you can help each other.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Much to your distaste, you actually serve your dragon, and it acts as the master in your relationship.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You and your dragon bitterly hate each other, but are forced together because of the bond you share. You both understand seperation could prove disasterous.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h4>OBSTACLES</h4>
            <p>Finally, having a draconic companion is not without its complications. Somewhere in your travels, your and your companion may have caused fear among travellers or gained the ire of a noble court. This obstacle might determinte complications that arise in your adventures.</p>
            <p class="indent">Should you choose to roll or select from the following obstacles, or create your own, be sure to consider how it affects how you and your dragon interact with others.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Obstacles</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>The mother of your dragon companion is searching for its child, and you worry it might find you.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>Bounty hunters are looking for your dragon, as it scales and teeth could sell for quite a lot.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>A village believes that your dragon is the cause for all of their problems, and seeks retribution.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>Due to your bond, you have slightly draconic features that make you appear untrustworthy and intimidating.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>A religious order considers you a heretic for putting a dragon under your control, and wants to "liberate" it for their own purposes</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You and your dragon used to be one whole dragon, and the sudden split is strange and uncomfortable</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>At 1st level, you gain the service of a dragon hatchling, whose statistics can be found at the end of this class description. The dragon’s colour is the chosen covenant colour.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you are ever slain (in battle or otherwise), your dragon will also die after a number of hours equal to your dragon knight level, during which it will attempt to do everything in its power to return you to life.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your dragon companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of precious gems per your dragon knight level, you can call forth your companion’s spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return a dragon companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.</p>
            <p class="indent">Returning your dragon to life is a gruelling process, and you must expend some of your own life force to compel the dragon back to life. You can choose to expend any number of hit dice when you finish the ritual. Make a Charisma check, with the DC being equal to 15 minus the number of hit dice you expended. The DC cannot be lowered below 5 in this way.</p>
            <p class="indent">On a failed ability check, the dragon is restored to life, but you aren’t able to regain any of the hit dice you expended for the ritual until 7 days have passed. Additionally, you and your dragon both suffer three points of exhaustion. On a successful ability check, the dragon is restored to life, and you can regain the spent hit dice as normal.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Also at 1st level, your dragon companion gains a variety of benefits while you two are together.</p>
            <p class="indent">The dragon obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on (no action required by you). When you and your dragon roll initiative, your dragon can change initiative to match your own. If you are incapacitated or absent, your dragon acts on its own.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your dragon can’t take the Attack action. Also because of its youth, it has yet to master flying, and as such, falls if it ends its turn in the air. Additionally, it can’t fly with a creature it has grappled or be used as a mount until you reach 9th level, at which point it is strong enough to properly trained to support other creatures.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your dragon companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your dragon uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. While not wearing barding, a dragon companion has a natural armour class of 10 + its Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your dragon companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It is also proficient in all the saving throws you’re proficient in. Also, your dragon companion can’t attune to or activate magical items.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each level after 1st, your dragon companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. The dragon’s hit dice are d10s, regardless of its size. When the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as a player would.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, the dragon cannot have its size increased beyond large (but would still gain the extra benefits of the *enlarge/reduce* spell, for example). The dragon’s level is equal to your dragon knight level for the purpose of calculating spells like *polymorph* and *true polymorph*.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your dragon’s abilities also improve. Your dragon can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your dragon can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your dragon shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your dragon shares your ideal, and its bond is always "I will protect my knight;  I will do the best I can for my knight; I will die for my knight."</p>

            <p>Also at 3rd level, your dragon companion has begun to grow, and can now take the Attack action on its turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when the dragon makes a claw attack on its turn, it can replace the claw attack with a special attack, which deals the same damage as a claw attack (unless otherwise specified), with the following additional effects, specified under each attack.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your dragon can replace a claw attack with one of these attacks a number of times equal to your dragon’s Strength modifier (minimum 1), and regains all uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <h5>BITE ATTACK</h5>
            <p>Elemental energy swirls in the mouth of your dragon as it lunges forward to strike. The target takes an additional 1d8 damage of your dragon’s relevant damage type. This damage increases to 2d8 at 9th level, and 3d8 at 14th level.</p>
            <h5>TAIL ATTACK</h5>
            <p>Your dragon’s tail whips at a creature within 10 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw, with the DC being equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your dragon’s Strength modifier. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone. The reach of this attack increases by 5 feet at 9th level, and an additional 5 feet at 14th level.</p>
            <h5>WING ATTACK</h5>
            <p>Rather than dealing the damage of its claw attack, your dragon can beat its wings. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of your dragon must make a Strength saving throw, with the DC being equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your dragon’s Strength modifier. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 10 feet away from the dragon. The radius of the push and distance a creature is pushed on a failed save increase by 5 feet at 9th level, and an additional 5 feet at 14th level.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b>Breath Save DC</b> =  8 + your proficiency bonus + your dragon’s Constitution modifier</p>
            <p>The shape of the breath is different depending on the colour of your dragon, as shown in the table below. The damage is the same as the dragon’s relevant damage type (e.g. a red dragon’s breath would deal fire damage).</p>

Additionally, your dragon can use an action to rampage and make a claw attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you’re within 5 feet of your dragon when they rampage, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against each creature within your reach that was attacked by your dragon during their rampage.</description>

                <description>
                    <p>When you reach 3rd level, you heighten your battle ferocity with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                    <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                    <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                    <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                    <p>The Elemental Practice Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spells level or higher. You regain all expended slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                    <p class="indent">or example, if you know the first level spell chromatic orb and have a 1st-level and 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast chromatic orb using either slot.</p>
                    <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                    <p>You know two 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, one of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Elemental Spellcasting table shows when you can learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st of 2nd level.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</p>
                    <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                    <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since your magic draws from the power and dominance of dragons. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                    <center>
                        <p><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier </p>
                        <p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
