        <description>
            <p>Connecting with the thunderclouds above him, a tall tiefling opens a small rift next to him, reaches in and draws out a spear, made of lightning and crackling with energy.</p>
            <p class="indent">Weaving her hands over the bucket of dirty water, a gnome’s companions saw how the dirt seemed to seperate from it and float into the gnome’s hand while the remaining, now clean water started to boil.</p>
            <h4>THE ELEMENTAL PLANES</h4>
            <p>Elementalists draw their power by connecting to the elemental planes through the elements that surround them. Many Elementalists choose to act as a guide to these untamed energies while others believe them to be but tools and shape the elements to their will.</p>
            <p class="indent">Impartial to anything or anyone, the energies residing within the Elemental Planes still seem to have some sort of alien consciousnes. Through this an elementalist can communicate his ideas and intentions to the elements, manipulating them, shaping them. An Elementalists spells are the elements themselves brought into reality, in whatever shape they occur naturally or otherwise.</p>
            <h4>THE WORLD’S BUILDING BLOCKS</h4>
            <p>Everything, be it man-made or not, is made up of a combination of elements. And these elements, in their core, are linked to the Elemental Planes. Using this connection an elementalist will extract power from these raw and chaotic planes, using it to shape the elements in front of him or creating new structures made from them.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A elementalist</h4>
            <p>Your background will very likely have a big influence on the approach you choose at 1st level, which will determine what type of elementalist you will be.</p>
            <p class="indent">In many uncivilized regions for example, Elementalists serve as the spiritual leaders for tribes and clans as they manipulate a dreaded danger to these simple folk, the elements. But they would never dare to fully control them, making them Guides, giving the elements room to run wild while leaving out their people.</p>
            <p class="indent">Born into a family of wealth might lead you to be a Shaper on the other hand, actively changing and shaping the elements with your will power.</p>
            <p class="indent">But how did you get to that point? Maybe you served as an apprentice to a Master elementalist, or maybe your natural talent led you to discover it in a situation or peril. How do you feel about other casters, using divine aids or arcane methods to produce similar results? What is your intention with the powers you have? Do you think the elemental planes and the energies within have a purpose, or are they a tool to be used?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an elementalist by following these suggestions. As a Shaper, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom and Consitution. A Guide on the other hand should have his highest ability score in Wisdom, with Charisma and Constitution as second. Next, choose the folk hero background. Third, choose the <em>ray of frost</em> and <em>elemental attunement</em> cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells <em>ice knife</em> and <em>earth tremor</em>.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an elementalist, you gain the following class features.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Be it through sheer luck and a drop of talent or study of your surroundings, you’ve found that you can connect to the primal energies that make up the universe. This connection to the building blocks of the world allows you to draw power from the Elemental Planes, either using those energies themselves or letting them fuel your arcane arts.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At first level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the elementalist spell list. You learn additional elementalist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the elementalist table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The elementalist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these elementalist spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL OR HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the elementalist spell list. The Spell Known column of the elementalist table shows when you learn more elementalist spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots on the elementalist table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the elementalist spells you know from this feature and replace it with another spell from the elementalist spell list. The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots on the elementalist table.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Your spellcasting ability depends on how you approach the connection to the elements. If you exact a lot of will upon the elements to do your bidding, like you do as a Shaper of Wielder, Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your elementalist spells. But if you want to act as more of a guiding medium for the chaotic, raw energies of the elements, like Guides do, Wisdom is your spellcasting ability. You use your Charisma or Wisdom repsectively whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma or Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an elementalist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma/Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma/Wisdom modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an elemental focus as a spellcasting focus for your elementalist spells</p>

                    <p>Hitting a target again with the same spell as last turn will let you apply a stack of cold energy. As a bonus action on your turn you can consume those stacks to decrease the targets movement speed by 5 feet per stack consumed for one round. If that reduces the targets speed to 0, it has to succeed in Consitution saving throw against your Spell Save DC or be stunned for one round. The amount of stacks applied is doubled if water is the primary element in the area.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When you choose this approach at first level, you want to use the elements to their fullest by shaping them to your will. The amount of influence you have over these wild and chaotic energies is represented by a number of control points. The number of control points you have is determined by your Insight modifier.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various shaping features. You start knowing three such features. You learn more shaping features as you gain levels in this class.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you spend a control point, it is unavailable until you finish long rest. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest studying the elemental structure of an object of your choice.</p>
                <h5>Helpful Flick</h5>
                <p>When an ally within 30 feet of you is in danger you can use your reaction to help them. When they would get hit by an attack, using 3 control points, you can grant them +2 to AC or +4 to a saving throw.</p>
                <h5>Shape Weapon</h5>
                <p>As a bonus action, you can reach into the Elemental Planes and draw out a weapon of your choice that lacks the two-handed or ammunition property. You are proficient with the weapon and when you attack with that weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. You can spend a number of control points equal to your proficiency bonus to add additional effects. Unless stated otherwise, you can only add an effect once:</p>
                <h5 class="caption">Energy Coating (1 control point)</h5>
                <p>The weapon deals an additional 1d4 of acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, poison, slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage. This damage increases to 1d8 at 11th level and 2d8 at 17th level.</p>
                <h5 class="caption">Guiding Forces (2 control points)</h5>
                <p>The weapon has +1 on attack rolls. You can apply this effect multiple times.</p>
                <h5 class="caption">Reinforced Structure (1 control points)</h5>
                <p>You can create a weapon with the two-handed property. The heavy property doesn’t effect you if you are a small creature.</p>
                <h5 class="caption">Elemental Weapon (1 control points)</h5>
                <p>The weapon deals acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, poison, slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage instead of its normal damage. You can also create a weapon with the ammunition property this way, using elemental energy as its projectiles.</p>
                <h5>Armor of the Elements</h5>
                <p>As a action on your turn you can spend control points to draw on the elements, covering your body in elemental energy brought into shape. You gain +1 to AC per control point spent and resistance to one of acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, poison, slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage for 1 minute. You can spend a number of control points equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>

You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, glas, or another highly processed material, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.</p>
                <p class="indent">Creatures or magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools used to craft such objects.</p>

                <p>Starting at 14th level, you can use 4 control points and your action to call forth an Elemental of an element available in the area (see the Biomic Elements table for that) from your rift to fight alongside you. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. It automatically disappears after 1 hour, when you summon another elemental or when it is dismissed by you.</p>

            <p>A Guide thinks that the chaotic energies in the elemental planes only wait to be given a direction. Believing that the elements are something primal that can’t be controlled, a Guide wants to act as a medium, to give those forces a goal. They use their natural perception for their surroundings to find the right ways to give the elements a little push in the right direction.</p>

The amount of guidinance you can offer these wild and chaotic energies is represented by a number of synergy points. The number of synergy points you have is determined by your Persuasion modifier.</p>

                <p>Starting at 1st level, as an action on your turn, you can open a small rift between the Material Plane and the Elemental Planes next to you. This rift is small in size but occupies 5ft of space. You can move the rift up to 20 feet as a bonus action on your turn. You can cast spells as though you were in the rifts space.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, utilizing this rift, you’ve learned to unleash the chaotic energies within the elemental planes in a few ways. As an action can spend two synergy points to create one of the following effects:</p>
                <h5>Chaotic Missle</h5>
                <p>Make a ranged spell attack against one target within 60 feet of your rift. On a hit the target takes 2d6 damage. Choose one of the d6s. The number it rolled determines the type of damage as shown in the Chaotic Elements table below.</p>
                <h5>Chaotic Burst</h5>
                <p>Each creature in a 5-foot radius around your rift must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save it takes 2d6 damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Choose one of the d6s. The number it rolled determines the type of damage, as shown in the Chaotic Elements table below.</p>
                <h5>Chaotic Instability</h5>
                <p>One creature within 30 feet of your rift must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save roll 1d6 to determine the effect it suffers for one round as shown in the Chaotic Elements table below.</p>
                <h5>Chaotic Elements</h5>
                <table>

                <p>Starting at 6th level, your understanding of the chaotic energies welling inside the Elemental Planes allows you to use them to your advantage.</p>
                <p class="indent">If you roll the same number on both d6s for your Chaotic Missle or Chaotic Burst, you can spend one synergy point to roll an additional d6 and add the result to the total damage dealt. Repeat this process until you don’t roll the same result anymore and use the last die rolled to determine the damage type.</p>
                <p class="indent">If this occurs at least once, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage of Chaotic Missle and the radius increases by 5 feet for Chaotic Burst.</p>

                <p>Starting at 14th level, listening to the Elemental Planes has become natural for you. Whenever you deal damage either by casting a spell through your rift or using an Elemental Gateway feature, this lets you use one synergy point to find the right frequency, allowing you to change and choose the result of one damage die after rolling or reroll all of them. You must then use the new result. You can use this feature only once per round.</p>

Whenever you deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, poison, slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage either by casting a spell through your rift or using an Elemental Gateway feature, you can use three synergy points to replace the damage type with its true form (e.g. fire becomes true fire), bypassing any immunity or resistance.

                <p>One creature within 60 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.

If it hits a solid object or another creature in this way, both take 1d8 bludgeoning damage. On a failed save it takes 3d8 slashing damage.</p>
                <h5>Water</h5>
                <p>A 100 feet long and 5 feet wide line blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each hostile creature in its path must succeed in a Constitution saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. Additionally, you can choose any number of allied creatures in the same line. Each of them gains 2d4 temporary hit points.</p>
                <h5>Earth</h5>
                <p>Each creature in a 15 feet radius around you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save it gets pulled 10 feet towards you, if it was closer than that it flies past you, and gets knocked prone. If it hits a solid object or another creature in this way, both take 1d8 bludgeoning damage. The 15 feet circle around you is now considered difficult terrain.</p>

                <p>Whenever you use your Directed Release feature you can spend an additional conduit point to immediately gather a new, different element in your body, no action required. In addition, if you have used all four elements in the last minute, you gain +2 AC, double speed, +2 to your spellcasting ability modifier and heal for 5 hit points at the end of your turn for one minute, in addition to the Elemental Enhancement bonus of your current element. After you have benefited from this you can no longer gain these benefits until you’ve finished a long rest.</p>

            <p>Sickly, turqoise light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light ignores terrain but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. It lasts until the spell ends.</p>

This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being invisible. The light and the poisoned condition caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.</p>

            <p>This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger boulder or a Large or larger pool of still water within range and another boulder or pool of water, at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You must have touched the destination boulder or pool of water at least once for 1 hour before, spending 200 GP worth of diamond dust for the attunement ritual. For the duration, any creature can step into the target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of movement.</p>

            <p>A beam of turbulent, swirling energies bursts out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 damage of either acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder, poison, slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell.</p>
