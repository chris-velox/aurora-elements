        <description>
            <p>A rugged farmer toils the land, wiping the sweat of his brow as harvests his fields – he works from dawn to dusk, a basket of corn over his back. A hardy peddler travels the road, selling pots and pans through small village for pittance. An overworked clerk sits over a desk, chewing the end of her quill as she feverishly works through a pile of letters.</p>
            <p class="indent">It ain’t much, but it's honest work. Commoners have never had any sort of special learning, but they make do through grit, long hours and hard work. They’ve earned what little they have. They work hard, they do their jobs – no one ever taught them how to swing a battleaxe or throw magic bolts around.</p>
            <p class="indent">But even so, commoners sometimes have adventures of their own. Because why should those arrogant knights and snotty wizards get to hog the limelight all the time?</p>
            <h4>STAY ALIVE AND WORK TOGETHER</h4>
            <p>Commoners know to stick together. They don’t possess any outstanding skills, but they help out where they can. When a regular person goes up against a rampaging dragon, or faces a savage goblin horde, they soon learn one lesson above all others; stay with the group or you’re dead.</p>
            <p class="indent">In that theme, commoners support others rather than handling problems alone. They will stay behind the big barbarian when the fighting starts, and they’ll let the wizards handle the fireballs. Commoners form teams, and they confront problems with friends by their side.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A COMMONER</h4>
            <p>Commoners make for uncommon adventurers, but it's not unheard of for a farmer to leave his home and go adventuring, or for a clerk to pick up a sword instead of a quill. Think about what reason an average person might have to go on an adventure; they may be seeking fortune and fame, or have been forced to by necessity, or maybe they are just bored of living a mundane life.</p>
            <p class="indent">Commoners are defined largely by their professions – the jobs that they work. Commoners can take on wildly different roles depending on their livelihoods. Seven subclasses are provided here: a hardy farmer, an enterprising merchant, an erudite clerk, a self-reliant vagabond, a vicious thug, a hearty innkeeper, or a jaunty jester.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a commoner quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score. Your second highest ability score depends on what subclass you choose; if playing a farmer or a thug choose Strength, if playing a merchant or a jester choose Charisma, if playing a clerk choose Intelligence, if playing a vagabond choose Dexterity and if playing an innkeeper choose Wisdom. Finally, pick whatever background appeals most to you</p>
            <div class="caption">
                <h5 class="caption">Variant Rule: Mediocre In Everything</h5>
                <p>Commoners make for a strange class in that they are meant to be unremarkable, and slightly less than average in everything. That doesn’t mean they are useless (they do have a few unique skills), but commoner is a class intended to encourage more role-playing opportunities rather than direct combat capability.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="indent">For a more challenging experience, you can choose to lean into this playstyle by making yourself truly average, and set all of your ability scores equal to 10 or 12. Good luck!</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an commoner, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>

                <li>One simple weapon of your choice.</li>
                <li>One set of tools with which you are proficient.</li>
                <li>One equipment pack depending on your choice of subclass: either an explorer’s pack for farmer, a diplomat’s pack for merchant and innkeeper, a scholar’s pack for clerk, a burglar’s pack for vagabond and thug, or an entertainer's pack for jester.</li>
                <li>10d6 copper coins.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>From 1st level, you gain appreciation of the struggles of the common man. People look at you and they recognize you as a steady, down-to-earth fellow – they can tell by the dirt under your fingernails or the weary gaze in your eyes. This has the following effects, dependent on who you are interacting with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) rolls made when interacting with everyday workers. Common folk look out for each other; bartenders become more likely to share scandalous gossip, farmers are more likely to shelter you in their homes for a night, and ordinary townsfolk are more likely to warn you about trouble.</li>
                    <li>You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) rolls made towards any merchants or swindlers who may be trying to exploit you of your hard-earned money.</li>
                    <li>You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) rolls made when you are attempting to convince any sort of authority that you didn't do something. Arrogant nobility is biased to assume that all common people are lazy and unremarkable, and they will naturally disbelieve you if you claim any great accomplishment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">In addition, you understand 'trader talk' – a heavy mix of dialect and jargon that is common among tradesmen and travelers. Trader talk sounds very rough and uses a great deal of obscure idioms (often referring to mundane objects through unusual names) which allows traders to recognize and communicate exclusively between themselves. It varies greatly depending on location and dialect, but commoners know how to translate heavily-accented voices and decipher any profession-specific jargon.</p>
                <p class="indent">Merchants will often treat anybody who understands trader talk differently; tradesmen will treat you as one of their own, unscrupulous merchants who would otherwise take advantage of you will not attempt so, and some may even offer favors or advice.</p>

                <p>From 1st level, you make do with what you've got and get the job done. You obtain your own personal trusty weapon. This may not be the fanciest weapon, but it's yours and you know how to use it. During a long rest, you can convert a set of artisan's tools with which you have proficiency to make your trusty weapon. You choose the shape, size and damage type of your trusty weapon as you are creating it, but it must be either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a one-handed melee weapon which deals 1d6 damage.</li>
                    <li>a two-handed melee weapon which deals 1d10 damage.</li>
                    <li>a sling with range of 30/120 which deals 1d6 damage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">When wielding your trusty weapon, the following features apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When making attack rolls, rather than adding your proficiency bonus plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier, you may instead add your proficiency bonus twice to the attack roll.</li>

                <p class="indent">Afterwards, any hostile creatures in the area are faced with a Perception check with DC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus, and on a failed check they will assume that you are dead and move onwards to another target. This effect lasts until you draw attention to yourself, at which point they will realize that you somehow survived.</p>
                <p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

                <p>At 6th level, your trusty weapon fits perfectly in your hand. After incorporating random magic materials and minor trinkets into your weapon, your trusty weapon is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to non-magical attacks and damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, your familiarity with your trusty weapon allows you to use it in unique ways. Choose one of the following properties and apply the effect to attacks made with your trusty weapon:</p>
                <h5>GRAPPLING BLOW</h5>
                <p>To you, your weapon is more than just a weapon – it's an extension of your arm. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using your trusty weapon, you can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the target. You do not need a free hand to grapple, as you use your trusty weapon to hook and restrain the target instead.</p>
                <h5>CRIPPLING AIM</h5>
                <p>You go for the hamstrings. When you land a blow on a creature with your trusty weapon, the target must pass a Dexterity check against DC 12 + your proficiency bonus, otherwise it suffers half movement speed until the end of its next round. This effect does not stack with any other sources of movement reduction. Regardless of whether the target passes the save or not, you do not provoke opportunity attacks from that creature until the end of the round.</p>
                <h5>KNOCKBACK SHOT</h5>
                <p>Projectiles from your sling have stopping power. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using your trusty weapon, you can knock a Large or smaller creature back up to 5 feet away from you in a straight line.</p>

When you and at least two other members of your team are within five feet of the same enemy, then all attack rolls made by your allies targetting that enemy receive a +3 bonus.</p>

                <p>Innkeeping is a profession for the empathetic and protective. Perhaps they can't fight that all well, but they can serve ale and cook up one hell of a stew. In many ways, innkeepers are a precious commodity – after all, when it's pouring down with rain and the party is trapped inside a stinky goblin's cave, most adventurers tend to wish if only there was a good innkeeper about.</p>
                <p class="indent">Innkeepers are those with experience running inn or tavern, they don't tolerate nonsense and they know how to look after their patrons. Sometimes, there is no better friend to have: they care for others, they feed the party and they get people up onto their feet.</p>

                <p class="indent">It's hardly the most dignified job, but often the greatest fools are cleverer than the men who laugh at them. A jester could be a traveling troubadour, a circus clown, or simply any person who likes to draw attention to themselves. Unlike bards, jesters have no magic to speak of – instead they are ordinary jaunty fellows wearing motley, dancing around and acting silly for the entertainment of the crowd. They smile, jape and laugh – but it's all an act, of course. A jester does what they need to do to get paid.</p>
                <p class="indent">Regardless, jesters making their living by being underestimated. It takes wits and skill to put on a good show, and some jesters are as shrew as they come. If nothing else, they know how to distract.</p>
