        <description>
            <p>A hooded figure runs across a rooftop, the shouts of pursuing guards breaking the quiet evening. A hail of crossbow bolts whistle through the air after him, but with a smile and a subtle bend of space they are sent astray as he continues his sprint, straight down the vertical wall of a building.</p>
            <p class="indent">The trio of bloodthirsty orcs surround a still elf in a forest glade, her eyes closed in readiness. They swing their weapons but at the moment of impact suddenly find them hitting nothing but air. Before they can recover, her shimmering blade swings with supernatural speed, separating their heads from their shoulders.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a skirmish rages, a halfling dashes through the combat towards a bandit chief. Grizzled bodyguards stand between them, but the halfling reaches out a hand and slips through a hole in reality itself, rematerialising and plunging a dagger into the chief’s neck. Behind him, his warping passage crushes the bodyguards into a misshapen mass as the space settles back to normality.</p>
            <p class="indent">These are all voidstriders, individuals who share an affinity for reshaping reality with their esoteric connection to the weave of magic. While others shape the power of the arcane into spells, voidstriders take that raw energy and apply it to both their physical selves and their immediate surroundings. The result is a keen minded and thoroughly lethal warrior, capable of creating bends and ripples in space and time to confound and destroy their foes.</p>
            <h4>CRACKS IN THE FIRMAMENT</h4>
            <p>The raw stuff of magic suffuses nearly all of creation, threaded throughout every plant, rock and creature. Those wishing to cast spells can draw upon this untamed power and through the careful use of knowledge, incantations and precise gestures they can shape it into specific spells. To such normal users of magic, a voidstrider is dangerous at best and an abomination at worst. This is because each and every voidstrider represents a living, breathing rupture in the weave of magic.</p>
            <p class="indent">Through them, its unmasked energy spills out into reality, distorting previously established fundamentals - space itself becomes malleable, whilst time might skip unexpectedly or repeat one or two seconds in a minute. Such is the unpredictable nature of this power that attempting to harness it for traditional spellcasting would be both futile and impossibly dangerous to the wielder. Only through rigorous control of body and mind can an individual begin to shape these distortions to follow their own will and direction.</p>
            <h4>THE PATH OF BALANCE</h4>
            <p>Voidstriders are, at their core, unstable beings. They may have been involved in some terrible ritual or experiment at some point in their life that exposed them to raw magic, or perhaps they were born during some calamitous event that left them slightly disjointed from the rest of the cosmos. Whatever their origins, each voidstrider has to learn how to control their abilities or be overwhelmed by them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Often shunned by society at large, voidstrider makes a natural fit for a traveling adventurer, with their unusual powers providing a unique and significant advantage in many situations, as well as their closeness of mind and body lending itself to an almost supernatural level of martial prowess. The adventuring life also matches well to the goals of a voidstrider, providing an outlet for their ceaseless energy and a chance to further hone and refine their self-control.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A VOIDSTRIDER</h4>
            <p>When creating a voidstrider, the most important thing to consider is what event linked you with the weave as well as how and why you learned to master the unnatural abilities that it bestowed upon you. Were you captured and experimented on to become the prototype for a living source of raw magic, imprisoned for years in the lair of some insane wizard before your escape? Maybe you were the target of a faulty resurrection spell and your soul is now intrinsically linked not just with your body but the stuff of reality itself? Perhaps you were abandoned as a child because you were unable to control your unnatural power and then taken under the wing of a thief that saw the potential of your strange abilities in their line of work. It could be that you were inducted and trained by a secretive order of mage hunters before being sent out into the world to further their goals with your unique skill set.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a voidstrider quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the hermit background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a voidstrider, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per voidstrider level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per voidstrider level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled mb">
                <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, rapiers, scimitars, shortswords, whips</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> None</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Arcana, Investigation, History, Sleight of Hand or Stealth</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) a rapier or (b) scimitar</li>
                <li>(a) a dagger or (b) any simple weapon</li>
                <li>(a) an explorer’s pack or (b) a scholar’s pack</li>
                <li>Leather armor</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Alternatively, you may start with 5d4 x 10 gp to buy your own equipment.</p>
            <h4>MULTICLASSING</h4>
            <p>The prerequisites for multiclassing into a voidstrider are a Dexterity and Intelligence score of 13. When you multiclass into a voidstrider, you gain proficiency in light armor, simple weapons, scimitars and shortswords.</p>
            <h4>THE LIVING VOID</h4>
            <p>Each and every voidstrider embodies a rupture in the weave, allowing them to distort space and time by their very presence. Some of your features require a creature to make a saving throw to resist the harmful or debilitating effects of twisting or altering these universal constants. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p style="text-align: center"><b>Void save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.</p>

When a creature that you can see targets you with an attack, you can spend a reaction to magically cause a stutter in time. After spending this reaction, roll a d20.

As long as you are not wearing heavy or medium armor, have at least one hand free and do not have your speed reduced to 0 (such as when Grappled or Restrained) you can spend a bonus action to Warpstep, magically teleporting up to 10 feet to a location you can see.

If you end your Warpstep within melee range of a creature, you can choose to sacrifice any remaining movement you have left to add extra force damage to your next melee attack this turn, equal to your Void Dice. The attack must use a finesse weapon to be able to add this extra damage.</p>

                <p>An innate and raw connection to the ruptured weave is the source of every voidstrider’s powers and all are able and skilled at the manipulation of reality’s constants to boost their martial prowess, though this can manifest differently between individuals.</p>
                <p class="indent">When a voidstrider chooses a discipline, it represents an intense focus on one aspect of reality that the weave is responsible for and, through training, coming to a mastery of that aspect. The Discipline of Momentum focuses on the mastery of space, traversing it and being fully aware of oneself and others within it, while the Discipline of Instance focuses on the mastery of time, freezing it temporarily and changing ones relative speed to the general flow of seconds and minutes.</p>
                <p class="indent">While all voidstriders are able to manipulate space and time to a certain degree, there are some that choose to specialize more towards one or the other to gain powerful and unique abilities.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 3rd level, you choose a Discipline that reflects this new focus: The Discipline of Momentum or Discipline of Instance, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice of Discipline grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 7th, 10th, 15th and 18th level.</p>

                <p>Starting at 18th level, you can temporarily flare up your spatial distortions, twisting the local area to benefit your allies and confound your foes. As an action, you can choose to become a Reality Rupture for 1 minute. While in this state, you gain the following benefits:</p>

                    <li>When you choose to Warpstep, you can teleport up to double your Warpstep distance.</li>
                    <li>You can spend a bonus action to magically teleport a willing creature that you can see up to your Warpstep distance.</li>
                    <li>You can spend a bonus action to force a creature that you can see to make a Charisma saving throw against your Void save DC. On a failure, they are magically teleported up to your Warpstep distance.</li>

                <p>At 3rd level, when you skip time to protect yourself, you also gain a brief moment of foresight, allowing for a brutal counterattack. Whenever a creature misses you with a melee attack as a result of your Temporal Flicker, you can immediately make a melee weapon attack against that creature as part of the same reaction. Any creature you later protect with your Temporal Field also gains this benefit, though they must spend their own reaction to make the attack. </p>

You can spend a reaction, either during your turn or immediately at the end of another creature’s turn, to magically stop time. You can then take another full turn of movement, actions and bonus actions. During this turn, all creatures other than you are considered blinded, deafened and stunned. After this turn, time resumes and all affected creatures are unaware of the fact that time was stopped. Creatures attacked will not know the attacker was you, you appear to instantly teleport between locations if you end your movement at a different location than when you started and any other interaction with the environment or objects within it will go unnoticed unless the results of such interaction are obvious.</p>
