        <description>
            <p>Although the gods work through many agents, perhaps none is more mysterious than the oracle. These divine vessels are granted power without their choice, selected by providence to wield powers that even they do not fully understand. Unlike a cleric, who draws her magic through devotion to a deity, oracles garner strength and power from many sources, namely those patron deities who support their ideals. Instead of worshiping a single source, oracles tend to venerate all of the gods that share their beliefs. While some see the powers of the oracle as a gift, others view them as a curse, changing the life of the chosen in unforeseen ways.</p>
            <h4>ROLE</h4>
            <p>Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a oracle quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p></p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>

                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per oracle level after 1st</li>
            </ul>

                <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast Oracle spells. Oracle by default uses a cleric spell list. See PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and for the cleric spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p class="indent">At 1st level, you know three can trips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Oracle table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p class="indent">The Oracle table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell guiding bolt and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast guiding bolt using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p class="indent">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cleric spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Oracle table shows when you learn more oracle spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the oracle spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>OPTIONAL: VERSATILE DIVINITY</h5>
                <p class="flavor">(Intended for use with Class Feature Variants UA)</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace one spell you learned from this Spellcasting feature with another spell from the cleric spell list. The new spell must be the same level as the spell you replace.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILLITY</h5>
                <p class="indent">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your oracle spells, since the power of your divine magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a oracle spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p class="indent">You can use holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your oracle spells.</p>

                <p>Each oracle is cursed, but this curse comes with a benefit as well as a hindrance. This choice is made at 1st level, and once made, it cannot be changed. The oracle’s curse cannot be removed or dispelled without the aid of a deity. Each oracle must choose one of the following curses. Any spells granted by the curse don’t count against the number of your known spells.</p>
