        <description>
            <p>Beneath the night sky, an elf is bathed in light as she focuses on a ritual. Her enemy approaches without fear or hesitation, believing she was foolish enough to leave an opening. As they move to strike, they’re pushed away from the elf by an unseen force. Before the enemy can comprehend what is happening, the ritual is complete and several darts of light shoot at them.</p>
            <p class="indent">A dwarf paces back and forth, trapped deeply in thought. The future held countless possibilities, but only one of them would come to pass. Would his kingdom survive, or would it be conquered by the empire? He doesn’t know the answer, but he does know where to find it. He opens the door and leaves his home, searching for the truth hidden in the sky.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a war rages around him, a human distracts an enemy soldier with a haze of moonlight. He counts every agonizing second spent on his ritual as he relies on his allies to protect him. After what seems like forever, his patience is rewarded. A warm light heals his wounded allies, and the war goes on.</p>
            <p class="indent">Astrologers stand at the pinnacle of rituals, making use of them both outside and inside of combat. By using the power of the cosmos to align the magic around them, they form the ideal circumstances for a spell to manifest. Which spells they can manifest depends on the celestial body they’re attuned to. They can call forth fire and light from the sun, healing and trickery from the moon, or force and travel from the stars.</p>
            <h4>ASTROLOGY</h4>
            <p>Astrology is the study of celestial bodies, and the lion’s share of an astrologer’s time is devoted to it. Through observation of the sky above, they’re able to learn about almost anything. Whether they desire to know what the future holds or how to read a language, knowledge is rarely more than a night away. Because they’re able to obtain knowledge through astrology, astrologers are often found as court mages, seers, or oracles. Though the sky can be seen wherever you are in the world, astrologers tend to wander. Each location has a different sky, and an astrologer can learn from each and every one of them. For the sake of learning everything they can, they travel to the ends of the earth. Adventuring goes hand in hand with travel, and due to that, many astrologers choose to be adventurers.</p>
            <h4>COSMIC RITUALIST</h4>
            <p>A spellcaster can normally bring a spell into existence with a mere word or gesture, but that isn’t the case for an astrologer. They specialize in the art of ritual casting, of causing a spell to come into existence without expending their own energy. They have an array of rituals learned through astrology, the most important being the cosmic ritual they use in combat.</p>
            <p class="indent">A cosmic ritual is the act of using the power of the cosmos to align the magic around the astrologer, which allows them to manifest spells they otherwise couldn’t and reduces the casting time of the ritual from minutes to seconds. Even with the fast casting time, astrologers in the past were vulnerable when they performed a cosmic ritual because they couldn’t defend themselves as they performed it. This was solved by taking a portion of the magic used to perform the ritual and converting it into light, specifically sunlight, moonlight, and starlight. This light can be used to strike enemies, distract them with a haze, or hurl them around without any effort.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ASTROLOGER</h4>
            <p>When making an astrologer character, consider the following. Where did you learn astrology? Were you taught by another astrologer, or did you learn about it yourself? Do you believe in destiny, and if you do, do you believe that destiny can be changed? What do you think your destiny or purpose is?</p>
            <p class="indent">Do you prefer day or night? Do you want to create your own astral sign, or are you satisfied with the astral signs already in the sky? What sort of sky do you want to see? How do you feel when you aren’t able to see the sky?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an astrologer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the comprehend languages and find familiar spells as your rituals.</p>

            <description>
                <p>As a student of astrology, you’re able to cast spells by aligning the magic around you with a unique ritual. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can use your bonus action to enter a Cosmic Ritual. While you’re in a Cosmic Ritual, you gain 1 star point each time you use Cosmic Alignment. During your turn, you can end the ritual (no action required) and expend a number of star points to instantly cast an astrologer spell, requiring no material components. The number of star points you need to spend to cast an astrologer spell is equal to 1 + the spell’s level. You can spend additional star points to increase the level of an astrologer spell that you cast. The spell’s level increases by 1 for each additional star point you spend.</p>
                <p class="indent">While you have at least 1 star point, you cast bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. While you have at least 5 star points, you instead cast bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet.</p>
                <p class="indent">A Cosmic Ritual lasts for 1 minute. The ritual ends early if you fall unconscious, if you enter another Cosmic Ritual, or if you choose to end it (no action required). If you have any star points remaining when the ritual ends, the star points vanish.</p>
                <p class="indent">The maximum number of star points you can spend to cast an astrologer spell in this way (including any additional star points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your astrologer level, as shown in the Spells and Star Points table.</p>
                <h5 class="caption">SPELLS AND STAR POINTS</h5>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr><td>Astrologer Levels</td><td>Maximum Star Points for a Spell</td></tr>

                <p class="indent">Once you have used Cosmic Ritual the number of times shown for your astrologer level in the Cosmic Rituals column of the Astrologer table, you must finish a long rest before you can use Cosmic Ritual again.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>You prepare the list of astrologer spells that are available for you to cast. Choose a celestial body - sun, moon, or star - and consult the associated list. You prepare each listed spell with an indicated level equal to or lower than your astrologer level.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you finish a long rest, you can choose a different celestial body and prepare that list of spells instead.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING RITUALS</h5>
                <p>Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any classes. The chosen spells count as astrologer spells for you. You can cast the spells as rituals, and can’t cast them except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Rituals Prepared column of the Astrologer table shows when you choose more spells from any classes. A spell you choose must have the ritual tag and be of a level no higher than half your astrologer level (rounded up).</p>
                <p class="indent">When you finish a long rest, you can choose one of these prepared spells and replace it with another spell, which must also have the ritual tag and be of a level that you can prepare.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your astrologer spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an astrologer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

            <description>
                <p>An important part of astrology is the existence of astral signs, otherwise known as constellations. Drawn in the sky by stars, they depict various objects and beings, defining the destiny of those that live beneath them. An astrologer can either abide by the astral sign they were born under or choose one for themselves. Due to the nature of astrology, an astrologer is deeply affected by their astral sign compared to other people. The knowledge granted by their astral sign and the influence it has on their destiny can determine the person they become.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 1st level, you choose a star sign that you were born under or have a deep connection with. Your sign choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
                <h5>SIGN SPELLS</h5>
                <p>Each astral sign has a list of spells - its sign spells - that you gain at the astrologer levels noted in the sign description. Once you gain a sign spell, you always have it prepared. If you have a sign spell that doesn’t appear on any of your lists, the spell is nonetheless an astrologer spell for you.</p>
