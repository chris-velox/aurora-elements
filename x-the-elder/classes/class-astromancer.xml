        <description>
            <p>Sitting in her creaking hut, eyes slowly becoming weak from pondering over a variety of star charts and augury bones sits an older half-orc woman, believing she is close to determining her tribe's destiny. She carefully rolls up an ancient looking scroll and sighs, gazing to the wall and seeing a dozen more maps and a set of dragonknuckles that must be examined by the morning for a full reading.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human man, scorned long ago by his home village for his ravings about the moon's glory, now stands atop a cliff pulling darkness from the surrounding sky as the crimson eclipse begins to pass overhead. He looks down on his previous persecutors as they seem to have difficulty escaping the encroaching night he has summoned.</p>
            <p class="indent">A long-haired elf, finally free to cut through their enemies on the front line, begins to sing in pleasure while fiery winds whip around their body. Brightness seems drawn to them, giving additional luminosity to their inspiring presence.</p>
            <h4>WIELDING THE COSMOS</h4>
            <p>Enraptured by the grand cosmic forces that dictate even fate itself, astromancers wield the might of celestial bodies to break their foes and unlock secrets within the great dark beyond. These wise sages are capable of weaving moonlight and starlight in order to hinder their foes, support their companions, or manipulate the battlefield.</p>
            <p class="indent">Astromancy is an elegant, yet dangerous and difficult art. However, the power that comes with revealing the workings of the universe and bridging the distance between arcane and divine serves as a lure, one that is particularly attractive to the most flexible adepts seeking inspiration or raw might.</p>
            <p class="indent">Adaptability and perceptiveness are the signs of a truly masterful astromancer. Each discipline, whether focusing on the moon, stars, sun, or otherwise favors those who are capable of evaluating a situation and using their abilities to the utmost for decisive action.</p>
            <h4>THE GRAND DESIGN</h4>
            <p>Those who specialize in astromancy need not be religious, but belief does often arise among them. Whether this tendency towards faith is prompted by the maginitude of power astromancers aim to manipulate, the nature of fortune tangential to their disciplines, or the overlapping domains between these casters and gods varies widely.</p>
            <p class="indent">It is not uncommon to find that students of this tradition have adopted gods of fate into their worship, recognizing that the designs of destiny to which gods tend and the constantly shifting organization of constellations and planets are one in the same. Some even view certain deities as the greatest practitioners of astromancy and pray to them for revelation.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ASTROMANCER</h4>
            <p>As you create your astromancer, one of the most important aspects to consider is what you intend to do with the power you hold. Do you have a specific goal in mind or are you simply attempting to explore the world to gather knowledge and wisdom? Do you plan to protect your homeland with the power of the sun or reveal secrets inherent to the world or further unknown places?</p>
            <p class="indent">You must also consider how you have gained access to your power. Were you visited by visions suggesting that you had a greater path to follow? Do you perhaps have an ancestor that received the favor from a being of the night sky? Knowing your past and how you gained mastery will be useful in deciding your potential disciplines within the art, but may even be the goal of your current adventure.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an astromancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the acolyte or hermit background.</p>

            <description>
                <p>You have learned to understand and control the immense forces that shape the world and weave the skein of fate. Your calling is that of one who seeks and sees greater truths hidden amongst the patterns of the universe. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the astromancer spell list for available selections.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>You know three cantrips of your choice from the astromancer spell list. You learn additional astromancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Astromancer table.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Astromancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your astromancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Faerie Fire and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Faerie Fire using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know five 1st-level spells of your choice from the astromancer spell list.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Astromancer table shows when you learn more astromancer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, both when gain a new level in this class, you can choose one of the astromancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the astromancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your astromancer spells. Your magic comes from the grand latent energies of the universe and your capacity to connect your will with them. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an astromancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                    <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast any astromancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use an arcane focus for your astromancer spells.</p>

                <p>At 1st level, your study or worship of the heavens has granted you a small fragment of their grandeur. As an action, you may summon a small Starmote for a selected creature within 60-feet, which sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. The mote and this light are only visible to the target.</p>

                <p>Starting at 6th level, your study of the stars allows you to tap into the latent energies beyond the world. Whenever you complete a long rest, you may spend one minute in meditation and choose two of the following constellations to gain access to for the coming day.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Tree:</strong> You gain temporary hit points equal to half your astromancer level, as well as resistance to the first successful attack against you which deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage until the end of your next long rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lantern:</strong> You gain access to the Light cantrip, if you do not already have it. and may cast it at a distance of 30-feet. You also gain advantage on initiative checks until the end of your next long rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Hand:</strong> You may select an additional skill or tool to become proficient in until the end of your next long rest.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Lovers:</strong> Once, as an action and using your astromancer spell save DC, you may cast Charm Person at 1st level without requiring any verbal or somatic components and without expending a spell slot. The target does not become aware of the charm at the end of a failed save.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Scales:</strong> Once, as an action and using your astromancer spell save DC, you may cast Bless and Bane at 1st level on two targets each without requiring any components and without expending spell slots. You may treat concentration for both spells as one for this feature.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Maw of Stars:</strong> Once, as an action and using your astromancer spell save DC, you may cast Dissonant Whispers at 1st level without expending a spell slot.

                <p>At 14th level, you have expanded your knowledge surrounding the workings of the cosmos such that you have learned to access the powers of more complicated astral relationships. You now choose three options for your Stellar Embodiment feature and may also pick your choices for this feature from the following options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> You may memorize one of your choice of <em>commune</em>, <em>dream</em>, <em>legend lore</em>, <em>scrying</em>, <em>telepathic bond</em>, or <em>teleportation circle</em> upon choosing this feature until the completion of your next long rest and may cast your choice using an astromancer spell slot. The spell learned from this feature does not count against your number of spells known and may be cast without any verbal, somatic, or material components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conjunction/Opposition:</strong> Once, as an action, you may designate two creatures that you can see within 60-feet of your position to make a Strength saving throw against your astromancer spell save DC or each move up to either 30-feet towards or away from each other in a straight line. If a target of this ability strikes a solid object or creature, the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10-feet it moved. If hitting a creature, the other creature must succeed a Dexterity saving throw against your astromancer spell save DC, taking the same amount of damage on a failure and half as much on a success. Creatures with a size above Large have advantage on the initial saving throw against this effect.</li>
