        <description>
            <p>An elf sits alone at the top of a cliff overlooking a small town. He keeps an eye on the movement of those below as he devotes the rest of his attention to sharpening and fletching arrows. A flash of light catches his eye. The signal. The elf picks up his spyglass to find the target. He catches sight of the dishevelled human stumbling from a worn barn.</p>
            <p class="indent">As the elf starts to nock an arrow a soft, blue light begins to suffuse his eyes and arms. Slowly, the glow spreads to the arrow, all while the elf keeps the human in his sights. As the light reaches the tip of the arrow, he breathes out and releases his fingers.</p>
            <p class="indent">The arrow fires so powerfully from the bow that the elf hears the sound moments after he’s shot it. It tears through the air as it charges toward its target, near unseen in its speed. The human walks several steps before he realizes there is a hole in his chest. As he falls to the ground with a wordless gurgle, the elf nocks another arrow and waits, eyes on the barn door.</p>
            <h4>KI: ENERGY REFINED</h4>
            <p>A cultivator will learn early in their training that ki is created when they condense the arcane energies that make up the magic in the world around them. It can be absorbed into the body and refined in one’s core, which normally resides just above the navel.</p>
            <p class="indent">Breathing techniques are used to refine ki, and there are as many breathing techniques as actual techniques. Regardless of how it’s gathered, ki is the driving force behind a cultivator’s power. It is used to augment their bodies and the world around them much like magic. This energy has birthed a multitude of techniques that cultivators use to prove themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">However, a true cultivator is someone who not only uses ki, but becomes it. This is the true goal of all those who follow this path.</p>
            <h4>MASTERS OF THE AURA</h4>
            <p>Most cultivators begin their journey by manifesting an aura as this is central to a number of cultivator techniques. This aura is fueled by their ki and it's presence affects people and the immediate area around a cultivator.</p>
            <p class="indent">A cultivator's aura is a force to be used in combat or outside of it. It is mentally and physically restrictive to their enemies, and a tool for diplomatic or coercive action to everyone else.</p>
            <h4>DEVOTED BODIES. DEVOTED MINDS</h4>
            <p>A cultivator will spend their entire life, often resolved to die training or fighting, focusing on their abilities. They will dedicate themselves to a single technique, spending their time improving it and making it their own. They train by fighting and constantly looking for the moment inspiration hits, driving their techniques to new limits.</p>
            <p class="indent">A cultivator must have a strong body to handle the stress that training and ki cycling puts on it. They must also have a mind just as strong to learn, improve, and apply what combat teaches.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A CULTIVATOR</h4>
            <p>When creating a cultivator think about your characters background and their motivation. Becoming a cultivator is a path that takes dedication. Why is your character so dedicated to growing stronger? An unfortunate event? A role model? How did your character begin to learn their respective technique. Were they taught at a dojo with others or under a master alone? It could even be as simple as a manuscript found in ruins.</p>
            <p class="indent">What you cultivator is searching for, whether it be looming or in the far future, can be important. Simple or not, something drives a cultivator to continue on.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a cultivator quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on your choice of weapon, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the Far Traveler Background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a cultivator, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per cultivator level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cultivator level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled mb">

                <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Calligrapher’s Supplies</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="unstyled">

                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, History, Intimidation, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Survival</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="caption">EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) a martial weapon and a Shield or (b) two Martial Weapons</li>
                <li>(a) a Longbow and 20 arrows or (b) two handaxes</li>
                <li>(a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="sidebar">
                <h5 class="caption">WHY NOT WISDOM?</h5>
                <p>This question has two answers actually. First, this class being so close to monk I wanted to distance it a bit. B, anyone who’s read a lot of cultivation fantasy is aware of how different cultivating is in each universe. While Wisdom would definitely fit in a lot of them I particularly enjoy the idea of knowledge based cultivation. That is not to say that you can’t switch the Intelligence based stuff to Wisdom. It’s your world, have at it.</p>

            <description>
                <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose a Fighting Style from the list of optional features. You can’t take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>CLOSE QUARTERS SHOOTER</h5>
                <p>When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.</p>
                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>
                <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
                <h5>DUELING</h5>
                <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
                <h5>GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
                <h5>INTERCEPTION</h5>
                <p>When a creature you can see hits a target that is within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.</p>
                <h5>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                <h5>TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
                <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8. When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.</p>

            <p>A majority of cultivators learn this technique in structured and well thought-out manners. They call to spirits, be it specific or otherwise, and commune with them. They then spend a majority of their time working together, training together, and fighting for their lives together. However, there are others who find their way to this path in a more...sorrowful manner. People who’ve lost partners, siblings, guardians, find themselves calling to the spirits left behind. Calling to the truth behind an existence. Calling to a life to carry on. Regardless of how cultivators find themselves on this particular path, one thing is certain. A Spirit Pack never fights alone.</p>

                <p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this subclass, you gain two spiritual companions. These spirits can be either existing beasts, or ones summoned to you through a special ritual during a long rest, but upon becoming your companions, gain a magical bond with you that grants them special powers. Your spirits can have the general appearance of any beast, but their stats are determined by the stat block below and the traits selected.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your spirits share the same health pool, but count as different targets in regards to single target and area effects. Getting both spirits in one area of effect ability or spell, does not deal double the damage.</p>
                <p class="indent">While in or out of a single stance only one spirit is summoned. Switching spirits is done whenever you would switch stances. Using your Ki Flood ability summons your second spirit to this plane. Both spirits will act on your initiative, following the normal rules stated below. If a class ability costing ki would apply to one spirit, you may spend double that amount for it to affect both.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spirits obey your commands as best as they can. They takes their turn on your initiative, though they don’t take an action unless you command them to. On your turn, you can verbally command (no action required) the spirits to move and to take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action, or use your action to command them to take the Attack action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the spirits to take the Attack action.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your spirits regain 6 + their Constitution modifier hit points every time you expend a hit die, and regain all their health at the end of a long rest. If you are incapacitated or absent, they act on their own, focusing on protecting you and themselves. They do not require your command to use their reaction to make an opportunity attack. If you don’t issue a command, they take the Dodge action.</p>
                <p class="indent">If your Companions die, they can be revived by recalling their spirits and causing them to reform at the end of a long rest at full health.</p>
