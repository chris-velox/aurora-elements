            <p><strong>A Witchfire Homebrew</strong></p>
            <p>Claws rip out of gloved hands and a beard shifts to a full mane as a dwarven champion hurries his way to the city gates, where he will shortly meet the invading army.</p>
            <p class="indent">Layers of torn leather slide over one another like tectonic plates while a warrior dances through the battlefield. His sword emits an eerie glow as he whispers ominous words that tears through both life and limb.</p>
            <p class="indent">A halfling noble majestically glides up to a smiling shopkeep, her golden curls radiating beams of light as if she were but a god solemnly asking for a mortal favor.</p>
            <p class="indent">Avatars are unusual creatures who can channel the spirit of an inhuman entity. Whether they invoke the supernatural to change their appearance, infuse it into their attacks, or perform acts short of divine miracles, avatars are fierce warriors with a set of uncanny powers.</p>
            <h4>THE MONSTER WITHIN</h4>
            <p>Avatars have been twisted by arcane forces that imbue the essence of a mythological creature inside them. They can channel this magic, known as mana, through spiritual conduits to manifest all sorts of magical effects. In addition, avatars have a refined martial prowess that perfectly compliments their unnatural powers.</p>
            <p class="indent">While the powers of a specific avatar depend upon the unique nature of their condition, they draw upon abilities reminiscent of the creatures they hold inside, such as ghost-like etherealness or lycanthropic transformations. In addition, their innately magical nature provides them with powerful regenerative abilities, both physical and spiritual, which make the most powerful avatars near-immortal.</p>
            <h4>CURSES AND BLESSINGS</h4>
            <p>The majority of avatars are born under fairly natural circumstances and obtain their powers much later in life. Most of them find their strange powers after encountering some sort of inexplicable phenomena. On occasion an avatar will be gifted their powers by a divine being in a similar fashion to warlocks, or find themselves magically charged as an infusion of powerful magic. Though rare, it is not wholly unheard of for an avatar to inherit their powers via their bloodline.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some societies view this fusion of spirits as an honor and hold them in great regard, while others ostracize them as degenerates, forcing them to the outskirts of civilization. As a result, avatars range from the proud adventurer and honored hero to the cursed hermit living in solitude.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an avatar quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, based on whether you want to focus on finesse weapons. Your next-highest score should be Wisdom. Second, choose the folk hero background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an avatar, you gain the following class features.</p>

            <h4>MULTICLASSING</h4>
            <p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Strength 13 and Wisdom 13</p>
            <p><strong>Proficiencies Gained:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial weapons</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ASPECT</h4>
            <p>You should follow these guidelines when creating your own supernatural aspect.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fabled spell options</strong> — If the subclass is based on a particular creature, consider selecting spells that are available to that creature or simulate its natural abilities. Also, keep in mind that a level 20 avatar can cast its 1st level fabled spell indefinitely without requiring a spell slot.</li>
                <li><strong>1st level feature. Flavor</strong> — the 1st level feature sets the tone for the rest of the subclass and should offer plenty of roleplay opportunities. It should not be one which relies on a resource or limited number of uses. A cantrip makes a good starting point for this feature.</li>
                <li><strong>6th level feature. Utility</strong> — The 6th level feature comes immediately after extra attack, and should be used for the main combat or utility ability. This should be where an aspect shows off its unique abilities.</li>
                <li><strong>11th level feature. Defense</strong> — The 11th level feature is defensive in nature, as this is roughly the point where the character starts losing their mortality by gaining the aspect’s signature defenses. As with the fabled spell options, you may look at existing creatures for inspiration.</li>
                <li><strong>15th level feature. Transformation</strong> — At 15th level the player is awarded their magnum opus, a 1 hour transformation where their character completely transforms into their aspect. This transformation should grant them abilities for both combat and roleplay, including at least one environmental feature.</li>
            </ul>

                <h5>DEFENSE</h5>

                <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

                <p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you learn how to manipulate your aspect’s innate magical energy, known as mana, to create magical effects, much like a sorcerer does. See the general rules of spellcasting for directions on casting spells.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Avatar table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your avatar spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell bane and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bane using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the avatar spell list, shown below.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Avatar table shows when you learn more avatar spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the avatar spells you know and replace it with another spell from the avatar spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your avatar spells, since you create spells by guiding the flow mana from your aspect. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a avatar spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>FOCUSED CASTING</h5>
                <p>Your supernatural aspect acts as a form of living arcane focus, allowing you to direct your magic without the need for a material component. As long as you are not incapacitated or unconscious, you can ignore the material components needed to cast your avatar spells, other than any components which are consumed in the process.</p>

                        <li>If a target is a fiend or undead, it regains 1d6 hit points per spent die.</li>
                        <li>If a target is neither a construct, fiend or undead, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 necrotic damage per spent die and become blinded until the end of its next turn. On success, it takes half as much damage and is not blinded.</li>
