        <description>
            <p>An overwhelming horde of orcs bears down on an elf and her fellow adventurers. She gives the order and her allies unleash a single coordinated attack cutting deep into their lines. Under her command the enemy is quickly routed against all odds, all according to plan.</p>
            <p class="indent">Deep within the once thought abandoned ruins, a halfling tends to his companions wounds as they rest. Countless long nights of study and training have conditioned him to keep going even when all others have exhausted themselves. He will see them through this.</p>
            <p class="indent">A dwarf in fine robes addresses a gathering crowd. What was the making of an angry mob begins to disperse, his mere presence putting them at ease, giving his companions time to make their escape.</p>
            <p class="indent">Scholars are master of the mundane arts, using methodical practices to turn the tables to their advantage. From years of study and testing, scholars take in the situation around them and quickly formulate the means to achieve whatever they have minds set to. Whatever pursuit they follow, a scholar will have a plan for anything that comes their way.</p>
            <h4>THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE</h4>
            <p>A true scholar is never satisfied. They are always seeking out a new answer to a new question. This often goes hand-in-hand with seeking a life of adventure, to explore new, hidden areas, or accompany those that do. The life of a scholar often times begins in the mundane, as a teacher or sage. Sometimes they serve as doctors, diplomats, or as members of the military.</p>
            <p class="indent">For scholars, mundane life is often too slow. When life becomes stagnant or when an answer cannot be found, the call to adventure rings louder. Scholars will often go to ancient, forgotten, and often dangerous places to find something to quench their thirst for knowledge.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SCHOLAR</h4>
            <p>As you create a scholar, it’s important to think of where you gained your knowledge. Did you serve as an apprentice under a master? Did you attend college or other formal education? Perhaps you gained it on your own, searching out and pouring over dusty tomes found in forgotten places. Where did your thirst for knowledge come from? Insatiable curiosity? Always wanting to know the right answer? Or do you have something to prove? Think about what field you wish to pursue and think of what is driving you in that direction.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a scholar quickly by following these suggestions. First make Intelligence your highest ability score. Your next-highest score should be Dexterity. Second choose the Sage background if you plan on following the Physician pursuit, the Noble background if you plan on following the Politician pursuit, or the Soldier background if you plan on following the Tactician pursuit.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As a scholar, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">

                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per class level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>

            <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) any simple weapon or (b) a light crossbow and 20 bolts</li>
                <li>(a) scholar’s pack or (b) explorer’s pack</li>
                <li>any simple weapon</li>

                <li>any two tools of your choice</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Alternatively, you may start with 4d4 x 10 gp to buy your own equipment.</p>

                <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
                <p>To qualify for a new class, you must mee the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.</p>

                <p>When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you only gain some of that class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.</p>

                <h4>Class Features</h4>
                <p>When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that level. A few features, however, have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Extra Attack, Superiority Die, and Unarmored Defence.</p>
                <h5>Extra Attack</h5>
                <p>If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.</p>
                <h5>Superiority Die</h5>
                <p>If you gain superiority die from another class, you gain one additional die to your existing pool of dice.</p>
                <h5>Unarmored Defense</h5>
                <p>If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it again from another class.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to apply your studies in practical ways known as maneuvers. Your maneuvers are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Maneuvers.</em></strong> You know 2 maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under “Maneuvers” below. You may only use a particular maneuver once per turn. Many of your maneuvers enhance an attack in some way, you can use only one maneuver per attack.</p>
                <p class="indent">You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice at 3rd, 6th, 11th, and 17th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Superiority Dice.</em></strong> You have a number of superiority dice as shown in the Superiority Dice column of the Scholar class table which are d6s. This die changes as you gain Scholar levels, as shown in the Academic Superiority column of the Scholar table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Saving Throws.</em></strong> Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <center>
                    <p><strong>Maneuver save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                </center>
                <h5>MANEUVERS</h5>
                <p>The maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Administer Aid.</em></strong> As an action, you can expend a superiority die to tend to a creature you can touch. The creature regains a number of hit points equal to the number rolled + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Assess the Situation.</em></strong> You can expend one superiority die to make a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check as a bonus action, adding the superiority die to the check.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Deliberate Movement.</em></strong> You can expend one superiority die to use the Disengage action as a bonus action and ignore the effects of nonmagical difficult terrain until the end of your turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Distracting Strike.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, and give your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack’s damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attack other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Evasive Footwork.</em></strong> When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Exploit Weakness.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend a superiority die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Measured Action.</em></strong> As a reaction when you make a roll for a contested skill check, you can expend a superiority die to add to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the contested skill check roll, but before any effects of the contested skill check are determined.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>One Step Ahead.</em></strong> As a reaction when you roll initiative, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to your initiative.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong><em>Reasoned Defense.</em></strong> As a reaction when you are forced to make a saving throw against an effect you can see, you can expend a superiority die and add the number rolled to your saving throw. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw roll, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong>Rapid Response. While moving, you can expend a superiority die and add 5 times the number rolled to your movement speed.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em></em></strong>Reassure. As an action, you can call out to a creature within 60 feet that can hear or see you that has been charmed or frightened.

                    <p>At 6th level, whenever you expend superiority dice to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points to a creature, you can expend up to two dice instead of just one, adding both to the roll. Both dice are expended as normal.

                    <p class="indent">As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature. The drinker has their exhaustion level reduced by one or has one of the following debilitating effects end:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One effect that petrified or cursed the target.</li>

                    <p>At 3rd level, you gain access to new maneuvers which reflect the progress of your studies into the political world. Whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose from any of the following as well. The maneuvers are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Call to Arms.</em></strong> If you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can expend one superiority die to act normally. On your first turn as a bonus action you can make a call to arms. When you do so, creatures you choose within 30 feet who can see or hear you who haven’t gone yet may act normally on their first turn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Overwhelming Presence.</em></strong> As an action, you can make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Intimidation) skill check and expend one superiority die to attempt to charm or frightened a humanoid creature who can see or hear you within 60 feet. Add the superiority die to the roll. The target makes a contested Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is charmed by you if you used Persuasion, or frightened of you if you used Intimidation, until the end of your next turn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Charge.</em></strong> As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to spurn your allies to move. Until the start of your next turn, creatures you choose within 30 feet who can see or hear you, have their speed increased by 10 feet and ignore nonmagical difficult terrain.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Goading Attack.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attack you. You add the superiority die to the attacks damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Inspiring Defense.</em></strong> As a reaction when an ally you can see within 30 feet who can see or hear you, makes a saving throw, you can expend a superiority die. Add the number rolled to the targets saving throw. You can use this maneuver before or after making the saving throw, but before any effects of the saving throw are determined.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Rally.</em></strong> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your superiority die + your Intelligence modifier.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Targeted Feint.</em></strong> You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 30 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attacks damage roll.</p>
                    <p class="indent"><strong><em>Tyrannical Strike.</em></strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die and issue a one-word command to a creature who can see or hear you. You add the superiority die to the attacks damage roll, and the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must follow the command on its next turn. The target automatically succeeds if it is Undead, can’t be charmed, it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.</p>

                    <p>At 6th level, as an action, you suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) to influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the effect.</p>
                    <p class="indent">The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for up to 24 hours. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the effect ends, the activity isn’t performed.</p>
                    <p class="indent">If you or any of your companions damage the target, the effect ends.</p>
                    <p class="indent">You may only use this feature once before finishing a short or long rest.</p>

                    <p>Beginning at 11th level, humanoids within 30 feet are particularly susceptible to your presence. Humanoids within range have disadvantage on saving throws against any charm or fear effects from you. Creatures who can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.</p>

                    <p>Starting at 17th level, you can call out to your allies, beckoning them to victory. As an action, you can expend any number of superiority die, giving each to a creature of your choice within 60 feet who can see or hear you.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Once, within the next minute, a creature may roll their die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.
