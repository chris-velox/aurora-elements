            <description>
                <p>At 1st level, you adopt a certain style of fighting. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
                <h5>AMBIDEXTROUS</h5>
                <p>When you take the attack action with a light ranged weapon that you are holding in one hand, you can use your bonus action to attack with a different light ranged weapon you are holding in your other hand.</p>
                <h5>ARCHERY</h5>
                <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
                <h5>CLOSE QUARTERS SHOOTER</h5>
                <p>Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature does not impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. Your ranged attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover against targets that are within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls with ranged attacks.</p>
                <h5>EXCEPTIONAL SKILL</h5>
                <p>You learn one trick shot from the Trick Shooter’s list of trick shots. Once per rest, you can use this trick shot without spending it’s grit cost. Once you have used this trick shot, you can’t use it again in this way until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <h5>FIREARM DEDICATION</h5>
                <p>During a short rest, you can spend time cleaning and practicing with a single firearm of your choice. Your dedication to this weapon allows you to use it more effectively. You gain a +3 to damage rolls with this weapon, and have disadvantage on all attack rolls with any firearm that is not your dedicated weapon.</p>
                <h5>NIMBLE SHOOTER</h5>
                <p>While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</p>
                <h5>RIFLEMAN</h5>
                <p>At the start of your turn, you can reduce your movement speed to 0 to gain a +2 to damage rolls for rifles.</p>
                <h5>SHOTGUNNER</h5>
                <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a ranged attack you make with a shotgun, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or 2.</p>
                <h5>THROWN WEAPON FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of taking the attack you make with the weapon.</p>
                <p class="indent">In addition, when you hit with a thrown weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll.</p>
                <h5>UNARMED FIGHTING</h5>
                <p>Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the d6 becomes a d8.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to the grappled creature. Until the grapple ends, you can deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Starting at 2nd level, you have a well of unwavering resolve called Grit. In times of extreme stress you have found that you can push yourself beyond your normal limitations, performing acts of incredible skill and perseverance. Your gunslinger level determines the number of grit points you have, as shown in the Grit Points column of the Gunslinger table.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can spend these points to fuel various class and subclass features. When you spend a grit point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you regain all expended grit.</p>
                <p class="indent">Some of your grit features require your target to make a saving throw against the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Grit save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <h5>HEARTY</h5>
                <p>You can spend 1 grit point to give yourself advantage on a Constitution saving throw.</p>

            <description>
                <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your gunslinging prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Arcane Gunner Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the transmutation and conjuration spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Arcane Gunner Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a transmutation or conjuration spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be a conjuration or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with a wizard spell. Any spell that refers to your Spell save DC uses your Grit save DC.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC (your Grit Save DC)</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

                <p>At 6th level, you learn how to get under your opponent’s skin. As an action, you can target a number of creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) within 60 feet of you, spending 1 grit point per creature. Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or be taunted by you for 1 minute. For the duration, a taunted creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.</p>

                <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your gunslinging prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the PHB for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the sorcerer spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>You learn three cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
                <p>The Powder Mage Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level sorcerer spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the evocation and transmutation spells on the sorcerer spell list. The Spells Known column of the Powder Mage Spellcasting table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an evocation or transmutation spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
                <p class="indent">The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be am evocation or transmutation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since you are using your grit to utilize your innate magic. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with a wizard spell. Any spell that refers to your Spell save DC uses your Grit save DC.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell Save DC (your Grit Save DC)</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

                <p class="indent">You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn an additional cleric cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p class="indent">The Preacher Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell bless and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast bless using either slot.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 7rd-level Preacher, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16 and a proficiency modifier of 3, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer, study, and meditation on spiritual scriptures: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>

You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when making an attack roll with a wizard spell.
