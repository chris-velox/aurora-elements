        <description>
            <p>An armored frontlining human takes blow after blow, and when she begins to weaken, she becomes all the more savage - hitting harder, striking faster, dying slower. A wounded dog is lethal, but a wounded atavist is a bloody nightmare. With caution halfway around the world, she wounds her own arm, but the enemy falls to the ground as he takes all the pain. Another foe comes near, but finding her only stronger than she was previous.</p>
            <p class="indent">An orc throws more than his all into each blow, hurting himself in a magical effort to strengthen his blows, but knows it’s not enough. He stills and lets the alien forces take over his mind, as his body erupts aberrant flesh strips, covering him entirely, growing out of holes and hairs - eyes darkening and true horror creeping. If his mark doesn’t falter at the mere sight of the abomination, he will soon fall in battle.</p>
            <p class="indent">The fireball rounds the corners of the maze, the wizard’s foul fire chasing his would be killer down the hall, but a sacrificial slight crippling of his arm gives him the power he needs to dodge out of the fiery current.</p>
            <p class="indent">No matter their upbringing, race, culture, or even time period, atavists are united by their ability to make use of their own vitality in their weaponplay. There may have been bloodlines at one point, but those are gone now.</p>
            <h4>OLD, VENGEFUL, AND SCATTERED</h4>
            <p>Before iron, before the blade, before organized cities, there were the atavists - using the only tools they had available: their bodies and their magic. In tandem, they use these dual aspects to protect, to conquer, to hunt monsters, or to achieve any other ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">These people build on failure. They take their combat training of reflexive attacks when they’re hurt and apply it to their lives: those that wrong atavists should know they will be struck back ten times harder. Some atavists even enjoy being attacked, hurt or betrayed, and use it as an excuse to hit back.</p>
            <p class="indent">Atavists can come from anywhere in the world: tribes, kingdoms, royalty, or gutter poor; however, those peoples that trend towards using hemomancy and other necrotic, vitality-affected powers would seem to have a higher chance of a child with atavistic powers.</p>
            <h4>THE ORIGIN OF HEMOMANCY</h4>
            <p>Magic that drains and takes from you is a studied and developed field that comes from atavists first. They started blood magic. But, what started the atavists? How did atavists begin in your setting—or is a piece of history lost long ago? Is it even important? Has it began multiple times, or can be it be restarted or instilled into potential users a variety of ways? Or, is every atavist in the same family tree, leading farther and farther back; it might lead to creatures beyond humanoids, perhaps from some union of opposite beings; or from a creature who has long left this universe.</p>
            <p class="indent">The power to use one’s own body in a general sense has been around for eons. Atavism is tied and twisted around that idea. To those born with the talent, it’s no more difficult than training an instrument for others - the inclination was born into them. However, many atavists were not simply born with it - through the prowess of a strong blood warrior, a child can be formed and shaped physically, giving him or her a much higher chance of developing atavistic powers. It’s up to you to decide how you obtained this talent.</p>
            <h4>POWERS WITHOUT DIRECTION</h4>
            <p>Many classes in Dungeons and Dragons have a clear indication and will for what a member would be doing - wizards study magic, paladins take up the cause of righteousness, and clerics serve their gods. But, many atavists have no such direction. If your character was ingrained with these powers through a blood rite, the question is, why?</p>
            <p class="indent">The same question exists for those who were born with the abilities. Are you part of some tangential, many-webbed plan of a deity or another powerful being, or was it just chance?</p>
            <p class="indent">If you don’t know the answers - like many of those in the world do not know the purpose of their lives - you decide it. Maybe you don’t care, and you focus on what you want and how you can get it in the future, instead of dwelling on the past.</p>
            <h4>INFAMOUS HEROES, OFT VILLAINS</h4>
            <p>The magic used (or abused) by atavists is normally questionable at best in most cultures, and when under close examination, can often be found to be a type that is commonly disowned, unsupported, and generally looked down on. This creates prejudice against atavists. They are more often cast as villains in stories, and tend not to be heroes; at least, in most of the world. It’s harder for an atavist to be admired and easier to villainize.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you have hidden your powers, or put them to an unusual cause, what effect has that had on how confident your character is? Would ‘I was born like this’ as a defense have held up wherever you came from?</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ATAVIST</h4>
            <p>The most important question to consider when creating your atavist is the effect that their powers have had on them - and how those effects and powers were treated by those around you. Did you lose sets of friends due to fearful ignorance? Did your family embrace and accept you for who you are, or did they turn a blind eye to your powers and hope they - or maybe you - would disappear?</p>
            <p class="indent">Atavists are known for their rigid health, physicality, and aptitude for circumstantially evil magics. Certain sages and other scholars would love to study you, or those with the same motives and less morals may pose a danger to you; maybe they already have. Do you wish you could hide or remove your power? Or do you want to defeat the stereotype you’re applied and become a hero?</p>
            <p class="indent">After your journey begins as an atavist, it might happen upon a new road. Are you a brutal warrior who wants to be attacked - a jaded, wearied soldier who will never fall? Are you a hopeful and strong warrior that has fallen to afflictions of the mind; the inluence of strange beings, that are a cursed blessing? Or are you a ruthless killer, lethal and weaponized, who will not stop to get what they want? Maybe you pledge yourself to or are pledged by a powerful fiend, who is respectful of your blood magic, and extends a fiery hand of power for you to grasp. You might even divine more power from meditation and self-reflection, with the idea that the more time you spend with yourself, the more able you are.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make an atavist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Constitution should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Dexterity (depending on what kind of martial character you want). Second, choose the Soldier background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an atavist, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d6 per class level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per class level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor, shields</li>
                <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons</li>
                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> None</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Strength, Constitution</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose two from Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Survival</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor</li>
                <li>(a) two spears or (b) any martial weapon</li>
                <li>(a) a greataxe or (b) a battleaxe and a shield</li>
                <li>(a) an explorer’s pack or (b) a priest’s pack</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>WEALTH ROLLS</h5>
            <p>Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment listed above and in your background, and buy 4d4 x 10gp worth of equipment from chapter 5 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i>.</p>
            <h5>MULTICLASSING</h5>
            <p>The prerequisites for multiclassing into an atavist are a Strength and a Constitution score of 13. When you multiclass into atavist, you gain proficiency with light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons. When determining your total spell slots, you add one half of your atavist levels (rounded down) to the total.</p>

            <p>By 2nd level, your physical essence—either through your family, the blessing of some divine (or unholy) being, or even through sheer chance has produced a fortified and living ichor within you, wieldable for magical prowess. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the atavist spell list.</p>
            <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
            <p>The Atavist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your atavist spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare the list of atavist spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the atavist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of atavist spells equal to your Constitution modifier + half your atavist level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 5th level atavist, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Constitution of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell inflict wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of atavist spells requires time spent attuning to your vitality: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your atavist spells, since the power of your magic relies on your own blood. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an atavist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
            <p><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
            <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
            <p>You can cast an atavist spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
            <h5>SELF FOCUS</h5>
            <p>When you cast spells that require a material component, you ignore that component unless it has a value, such as the diamond dust worth 100 gp for the <i>greater restoration</i> spell, in which case the components are required.</p>

            <p>This spell creates an undead familiar. Organically created from the bites of vampires, cruorbats can be summoned for a short while through mirrored forms of hemomancy. When you cast this spell, choose a corpse of a Large or smaller bat within range. The target becomes a cruorbat, but only of a size fitting for its corpse (the statistics can be found on pg. 33 of the <i>Dark Arts Player’s Companion</i>).</p>
            <p class="indent">On each of your turns, you can verbally command the cruorbat you made if the cruorbat is within 60 feet of you. You decide what action it will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you issue no commands, the cruorbat only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the cruorbat continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>
            <p class="indent">The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any commands you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creautre for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the cruorbat again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of this spell reasserts your control of the cruorbat you animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.</p>

            <p>For the duration, you cause a creature of your choice to undergo a spontaneous expansion of sinews, bones, muscle, organs; their entire body. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution throw to be unaffected on a success. Everything the creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.</p>
            <p class="indent">The target’s size quadruples in all dimensions and its weight is multiplied by thirty-two. This growth increases its size by two categories—from Medium to Huge, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the target to double its size, the creature attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and can reroll one of the dice once. The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them add your spellcasting modifier as extra damage.</p>

            <p>You touch a creature who must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are cursed, and their bones slowly begin to dissolve and regrow under their skin. This spell has no effect against creatures who are immune to poison damage or the poisoned condition. After they finish their first long rest, they become poisoned. After the second, deafened; after the third, restrained; fourth, incapacitated; fifth, paralyzed; sixth, petrified.</p>
            <p class="indent">To be cured a creature must be healed by a healing spell or any <i>restoration</i> spell of the same level of day progression they are on or higher. Once three days have passed for a petrified creature under the effect of the spell, only 9th level magic can cure them.</p>

            <p>You momentarily rip apart blood vessels of a creature you choose within range, who must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, for every 5 feet of movement they make for the duration to a maximum of 60, they lose 2d12 hit points due to blood loss or half as much on a success as their blood pours through their skin and out of their body, as if they were a cup overflowing with water. They take this damage even if they were moved against their will. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. For any success, the spell ends.</p>
