        <description>
            <p>An elven woman strides calmly through a forest glade, smirking as she subtly grips her sheathed blade. She closes her eyes as brigands leap from the surrounding brush. Before they can even shout their demands, the woman’s blade makes a wide arc at the group. Each brigand manages to barely dodge her preemptive strike, but their movements suddenly stop as they start to draw their blades. A large wound appears across each of their torsos where her blade had grazed them, and then they slump to the ground.</p>
            <p class="indent">Atop a grassy plateau, a lone human figure stands in total focus amidst a swarm of hovering spectral blades. Like a masterful conductor, the figure directs the blades to fluidly strike the targets painted on the stones around. With a quiet whisper of pride, the figure recalls the blades before willing them to fall to dust and blow away with the wind.</p>
            <p class="indent">A battle rages upon a blood-soaked field overlooked by a regal keep. In its center, stands a lone battle-worn tiefling fighting for his life. A pair of hulking spectral arms sprout from his back, allowing the tiefling to wield four axes at once. He charges into a group of soldiers, wreathing himself in flames as the lone figure carves into the enemy line. Each step taken could be his last, yet the tiefling fights with the widest of grins.</p>
            <p class="indent">Although these warriors fight using a diverse range of extraordinary methods, they are all disciples. Disciples are defined by their mystical fighting styles and the introspective focus that gives purpose to their training. For a disciple, combat is a conduit of self-improvement, and battlefields exist to test the strength of ideals.</p>
            <h4>MASTERS OF TEMPO</h4>
            <p>The key to a disciple’s magic prowess is awareness and focus. Every movement a creature makes causes a small, nearly imperceptible ripple across elements of the weave of magic. Using their ideals as an anchor for their focus, disciples enter a state of utter clarity where they can perceive and read these ripples, ultimately utilizing the power within these ripples---called <i>tempo</i>---to fuel their mystical techniques. As a disciple grows and solidifies their grasp on their ideals, their ability to maintain this focus increases drastically, improving their martial abilities.</p>
            <h4>FORGED IDEALS</h4>
            <p>A disciple’s ideals are represented in their fighting style by the sublime disciplines they follow. While some disciples discover these paths themselves, others learn them from masters of the art. Each sublime discipline holds one ideal above all others, and it serves as the anchor for the tempo techniques of that discipline. As a result, combat using these disciplines is a form of self expression and an opportunity to refine one’s philosophy. The danger and rigor of the battlefield provides the perfect situation to test the disciple’s focus, their understanding of themselves, and their values.</p>
            <h4>BORN WANDERERS</h4>
            <p>Because of this predisposition towards experience and conflict, it is rare you’ll find a disciple that stays in one place for too long or subsisting under the yoke of military regulation. They are natural wanderers and tend to flock towards interesting people that may lead them to greater challenges and adventures. Such people often prove to be worthy rivals and life-long friends for the wandering disciple: the perfect sparks to ignite the flames of inspiration.</p>
            <h4>ETERNAL STUDENTS</h4>
            <p>To a disciple, survival is often secondary to growth. To that end, you may yet find disciples working as sellswords or mercenaries in an attempt to find new conflicts to test themselves. Each and every fight is an opportunity to push past one’s limits, and test not only ability, but also their willpower and determination. The path of the disciple is one filled with decision. Each must decide which disciplines to pursue and which to discard, as the path to perfection is littered with broken philosophies and weak hearts.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A DISCIPLE</h4>
            <p>When you are creating your disciple, the most important thing to consider is why they fight. For a disciple, fighting is a means of self-discovery and affirmation. What kind of lessons have their fights taught them up until this point? What kind of person or warrior do they strive to be, and how close to that idealized version of themselves are they? Do they have a specific person or creature they are trying to defeat? Or perhaps they are seeking out a new mentor to fill a gap they feel in their skill or personhood? Consider how your character would feel when faced with what looks to be an insurmountable threat, and how they would feel after losing or defeating it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Equally important is when your character first began to notice the flow of tempo around them. Was it something they always saw, but never realized its significance? Maybe it was inherited? Or maybe the power was unlocked in a dire moment of emotional or physical danger? Or did you eventually come to see the tendrils of tempo through deliberate training, either alone or under a master or school? Which discipline did you manifest first, and why? Lastly, how does your character feel about their power now? How your character first came upon this magic should influence how they feel about both it and themselves in relation to it.</p>
            <h5>AWAKENINGS</h5>
            <p>Tempo is a transient energy, and it takes a very keen sense to be able to tap into it. However, how one learns to tap into this energy can vary greatly, and the manner in which you unlock your power should reflect how you think about your abilities and their purpose.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Awakenings</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>You spent a great deal of your life training under a master of a discipline to gain your sense.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>One of your loved ones was murdered in cold blood in front of your very eyes. In that moment, you tapped into that wellspring of anguish, and your senses flared.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>Ever since you could remember, you could feel the coursing ripples of tempo around you.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You were an malcontent soldier who awakened when you entered a fated duel with a disciple.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>Since you were a child, your family groomed you to be the most adept disciple in the land.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You went on a quest to find purpose, and in your lonesome introspection, you found the calling of the disciple.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h5>UNFORGETTABLE SIGHTS</h5>
            <p>Disciples are natural wanderers, always in search of a new challenge they can use to hone themselves. Almost every disciple’s wanderlust eventually leads them to some place that leaves an incredible impression on them. Whether negative or positive, this impression will help inform some of the disciple’s goals and world views.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Sights</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>Amidst an ancient ruin, you came upon an ornate fountain. When you looked into its waters, it showed you a pivotal moment from your future.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You decided to climb the highest mountain you knew of and witnessed the world sprawled below you at its peak. In that moment of awe, you made yourself a vow.</td></tr>

                <tr><td>6</td><td>You slew or bore witness to the slaying of the last remaining member of a type of magical creature.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h5>PERSONAL FLOURISH</h5>
            <p>Self expression on the battlefield is the lifeblood of disciples, and as such many disciples develop their own personal touches to combat or personal philosophies of battle.</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>d6</td><td>Flourishes</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td>You call out the names of your signature arts and tempo techniques as you perform them.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>2</td><td>You can spin your weapons absurdly fast and do so in combat or in anticipation of combat.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>3</td><td>You have a personal symbol that you place on the bodies of those who you defeat in combat.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>4</td><td>You analyze and copy the martial stances of your opponents without thinking.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>5</td><td>You try to position yourself in front of your allies whenever possible in order to always be in the action.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>6</td><td>You spare enemies you deem fit, in hopes they will grow and challenge you again.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a disciple quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on weapons that use strength or finesse weapons. Your next-highest ability score should be Wisdom and then you make Constitution your third-highest score. Second, choose the folk hero background.</p>

    <element name="Sublime Discipline" type="Class Feature" source="r/Unearthed Arcana" id="ID_RDDT_UA_CLASS_FEATURE_DISCIPLE_SUBLIME_DISCIPLINE">
        <description>
            <p>A disicple’s path begins with learning sublime disciplines. A sublime discipline is a kind of mystical martial art. Each discipline is centered on an ideal for the disciple to understand and internalize.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 1st level, choose one sublime discipline, detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain disciple levels, you gain knowledge of new disciplines, as shown on the Disciplines Known column of the Disciple table.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the disciplines you know and replace it with another discipline.</p>
            <h5>SIGNATURE ART</h5>
            <p>Each sublime discipline has an associated Signature Art, the foundational ability of the discipline. You can use this feature to invoke the effects of the Signature Art of a discipline you know. You can only have the effects of one Signature Art active at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h5>TEMPO TECHNIQUES</h5>
            <p>Each discipline has a list of techniques─its discipline techniques─that you gain at the disciple levels noted in the discipline’s description. These techniques require you to spend tempo points to use which you gain at 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some techniques modify a specific attack. You can only use one such technique per attack.</p>
            <h5>TEMPO ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Your ability to utilize tempo is tied your intuition and ability to perceive the ripples of magic around you; as such, Wisdom is the key ability for disciples. Some of your discipline features require for your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Tempo Save DC</b> = 8 + your Proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

It is your charge to turn your ire upon those who sought to bring you down and take from them that which you are owed.

Any creature struck by the statue becomes wreathed in stone chains, causing its speed to be reduced by half until the start of their next turn.</p>

You can mentally wield any one of these weapons, which can use the statistics of any simple or martial weapon that lacks the special property. In order to use one of these weapons, you need free hands equal to the amount you’d need to wield the weapon. These weapons deal force damage instead of their normal type, gain the thrown property (range 20/60), and immediately return to your space after any attack. If you fall unconscious, the weapons are dismissed.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you hold a weapon and meditate for 1 hour over the course of a short or long rest, you can bind the weapon to your arsenal, causing it to disappear. When you summon your arsenal, you can summon this weapon as part of it. You can have a number of weapons bound this way equal to your disciple level. A weapon becomes unbound if you die or unbind it with an action, causing it to appear within 5 feet of you, . You cannot bind with artifacts or sentient weapons.</p>

            <p class="indent"><b>Storm. </b>The weapons expand into the area within 15 feet of you instead of 5 feet.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, you have learned how to merge your body with your armory, embedding within you its fluid movement. While you have your arsenal conjured, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed, which manifests visually as wing-like blades, riding a flying sword, or a similar effect.</p>

            <p>At 18th level, you can bring out the full force of your arsenal in an instant. As an action, you create a visage of your field behind you and conjure 100 weapons all around you. Choose any number of creatures within 120 feet of you, and divide 100 projectiles among them (a creature can be targeted by up to 10 projectiles). Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d8 force damage for each projectile launched at it, or half as much on a successful save. These weapons disappear at the end of your turn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A disciple who follows the Journey of the War God is unmistakable on the battlefield by the manifestation of their soul fighting alongside them, often taking the form of spectral arms or a looming figure at their back.</p>
            <p class="indent">The influence of tempo can reach further than most would think; after all everything moves, even your own spirit. Disciples that define themselves by intense emotions, or a need to prove their own self worth, can develop a sensitivity to the movements of their soul. After enough time, the disciple gains the ability to summon and wield this element of their soul in combat. Legends speak of disciples that attain definite control, and ultimately learn harness the divine spark that resides within them.</p>

            <p>When you choose this journey at 3rd level, your passion can call forth the part of your soul that revels in the glory of battle. As a bonus action or when you roll initiative, you can manifest or dismiss two spectral arms that are connected to your upper body. When summoned, and on each of your turns thereafter, each arm can perform an object interaction, such as drawing a weapon. You can control these arms easily, and they act just like your other arms.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, you can make a single attack with each melee weapon you and your spectral arms are wielding (up to 4 attacks). You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of these rolls, unless that modifier is negative. When wielding a two-handed weapon, your spirit arms must hold the weapon with both hands at all times.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 5th level, you add your ability modifier to the damage rolls of weapons you are wielding with your hands (up to 2 attacks). At 11th level, you also add your ability modifier to the damage rolls of weapons your spirit arms are wielding.</p>
