        <description>
            <p>Chanting as his eyes roll back, an orc breathes in incense and smoke from a ritual fire to contact the spirits of his ancestors. His mind begins to commune with the spirits as he seeks guidance and wisdom.</p>
            <p class="indent">Foraging through the underbrush, a lizardfolk opens his mind to the life forces of the plants and animals around him. The ebb and flow of the spirits of nature guide him to the medicinal plants he needs to craft healing poultices and rejuvenating medicine for his village.</p>
            <p class="indent">Crouching in a tall tree, a young human watches as a hobgoblin warlord attempts to lead a raid against a village. He murmurs incantations and reaches out the very spirit of fate and chance. He wills the spirits to twist the strands of fate around the goblin, causing him misfortune and failure, and thwarting the goblin band’s attack.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whether supporting allies with helpful essence of nature or vexing their foes with the energies of death and misfortune, witch doctors are the conduits between the material world and the world of spirits. Most small villages and tribal cultures will have a witch doctor that tends to them, healing their wounds, protecting them from attack, and providing wisdom and guidance.</p>
            <h4>SPRITUAL CONDUITS</h4>
            <p>A witch doctor’s magic comes from his bonds with spirits. Different witch doctors form bonds with different spirits, whether those of nature, the spirits of the departed, or the spirits guiding the loom of fate itself.</p>
            <p class="indent">Because they mostly focus on serving their tribes and villages, many witch doctor spells are oriented toward strengthening and rejuvenating their allies, or towards undermining their enemies abilities</p>

            <description>
                <p>Drawing from the spirits of the life and the natural world, you can cast spells to channel those spirit energies to affect the world around you. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting, and the end of this document for the witch doctor spell list.</p>
                <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
                <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the witch doctor spell list. You learn additional witch doctor cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch Doctor table.</p>
                <h5>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h5>
                <p>The witch doctor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these witch doctor spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent">You prepare the list of witch doctor spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the witch doctor spell list. When you do so, choose a number of witch doctor spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your witch doctor level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 3rd-level witch doctor, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list o f prepared spells.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of witch doctor spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your witch doctor spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to the spirits. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch doctor spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
                <p>You can cast a witch doctor spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
                <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
                <p>You can use a spiritual focus (listed below) as a spellcasting focus for your witch doctor spells.</p>
                <h5 class="caption">SPIRITUAL FOCI</h5>
                <p>The following options are available for use as your spiritual focus. Unlike most other foci, spiritual foci are handcrafted and unique to each witch doctor. Instead of buying a focus, you craft it while in communion with the spirits. Each focus requires raw materials worth a certain amount of GP, all of which are consumed in the process. This doesn’t change anything mechanically. It is only intended to provide more flavor to your character and you are free to disregard it.</p>

                <p>Beginning at 1st level, you can open your senses to the spirits. You gain the following features:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Vision Quest.</i></b> As an action, you enter a trance to implore the spirits for advice. You must spend at least 10 minutes communing with the spirits. These spirits provide you with cryptic images, sounds, and other sensations. Work with your DM to interpret these messages.</p>
                <p class="indent">Beginning at 5th level, you can attempt to summon a specific spirit of your choice, such the soul of a dead person, or the guardian spirit of a grove in the Feywild, and ask it a single yes or no question. Spirits that are friendly to you may choose to answer your question, but unfriendly spirits may resist. If you summon an unfriendly spirit, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC to resist answering your question.</p>
                <p class="indent">At 11th level you can ask up to three yes or no questions of your summoned spirit, and at 18th level you may ask as many questions as you wish without requiring a saving throw. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Ethereal Sight.</i></b> As a bonus action, you gain truesight out to a range of 30 feet. This effect lasts for 1 minute. At 6th level the range extends to 60 feet, and at 18th level the duration becomes 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>A Voodoo Priest channels spirits of death and the undead. They see death as a natural part of life, and commune with the departed spirits of once living creatures. Their connection with departed spirits and the magics of death and the afterlife allow them to call forth the dead themselves, as well as protecting themselves against the necrotic energies of undeath.</p>
            <p class="indent">Voodoo Priests are sometimes accused of delving too deep into necromancy, often feared much as liches are. But rather than trying to conquer and defeat death, Voodoo Priests see the departed as allies and friends. They use their connection to these spirits to seek their help, rather than their service.</p>

            <p>Head hunters differ from most other witch doctors, being much more comfortable being in the fray of a battle. While most witch doctors will lurk in the back and work to give their allies advantages, head hunters will scout ahead as assassins, hunters, scouts, and reconnaissance. To that end they have focused their connection to the spirits into hiding themselves from detection and empowering their weapons.</p>

You can have only 1 Voodoo doll attuned at a time. As long as your doll is attuned to the target, you can use an action to use pins or thorns to prick the doll. If you do, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be affected by your doll. On a failed save, the target suffers 1d6 necrotic damage or one of the following effects.</p>
                <p class="indent">Pricking different body parts on the doll will inflict different effects:</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Blind:</i></b> Until the start of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Deafen:</i></b> Until the start of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Torso:</i></b> Until the start of your next turn, the target cannot regain hit points.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Arms:</i></b> Until the start of your next turn, the target has disadvantage on attacks made with weapons or unarmed strikes</p>
                <p class="indent"><b><i>Legs:</i></b> Until the start of your next turn, the target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet</p>
                <p class="indent">You can choose other effects, such as holding a torch to the doll to cause burns to your target. Work with your DM to determine what effects you can inflict with your voodoo doll.</p>

                <p>As a bonus action, you can create maddening visions of doom and despair in the mind of a cursed or hexed creature within range and its companions.</p>
                <p class="indent">When you do so, you deal 1d6 psychic damage to the cursed target that you can see, and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of it.</p>
