            <p>You can unleash the hidden wealth of power within yourself, threatening to destroy everything. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Charisma Score increases by 1.</li>
                <li>When you cast a sorcerer spell, you can spend a number of hit dice equal to the level oof the expended spell slot. If you do, the expended spell slot counts as a spell slot of one level higher (to a maximum of 9th), and you take 1d6 necrotic damage for each hit die expended. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While you are wielding a shield, it is considered a martial melee weapon with which you are proficient, and it deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. In addition, when you score a critical hit with a shield, the target can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</p>

            <p>Your fiercely-honed bow training has given way to an incredible technique.</p>
            <p>Once per turn, you can nock multiple arrows in place of one of your attacks with a shortbow or longbow. The maximum number of arrows you can nock at once is equal to your proficiency bonus. You can aim at one target or several, provided your targets aren't on opposite sides of you.</p>
            <p>Make separate attack and damage rolls for each arrow. You receive a penalty to each attack roll equal to the number of arrows you nocked, and you do not add your ability modifier to the damage of these arrows, unless that modifier is negative.</p>
