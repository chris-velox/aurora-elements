            <p>You can unleash the hidden wealth of power within yourself, threatening to destroy everything. You gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Charisma Score increases by 1.</li>
                <li>When you cast a sorcerer spell, you can spend a number of hit dice equal to the level oof the expended spell slot. If you do, the expended spell slot counts as a spell slot of one level higher (to a maximum of 9th), and you take 1d6 necrotic damage for each hit die expended. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</li>
            </ul>
