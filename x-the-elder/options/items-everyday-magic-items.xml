        <description>
            <p>This seemingly unassuming ring which has two spell equations embossed on it. It is usually given to housekeepers and maids of rich folk; and on rare occasions, the rich folk may wear one themselves.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, the wearer may cast:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><i>Presdigitation</i>: Only the effects related to food, cleaning or creating or snuffing fire.</li>
                <li><i>Thaumaturgy</i>: You may only open or close doors.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="indent">The wearer may only have one of the non-instantaneous effects active at a given time. Any attemmpts to exceed this limit will fail, dismissing the currently active effect as well.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This leather-bound tome has a sigil on its front cover which glows slightly in dim light. Its first four pages unfold into a large map which is blank. The map fills in as the bearer of the map moves <i>after</i> it has been first opened. As an action, the bearer of the map may use 5gp worth of ink to make the Wanderer’s Atlas "capture" the area in front of it, making a perfect image of the area. The image is also displayed with the corresponding are on the magical map. Otherwise, this tome acts like a regular notebook.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This rather bland looking slab of polished granite was enchanted by priests of Pelor to help out those too poor or sick to acquire firewood or coal.</p>
            <p class="indent">When it’s command word is spoken, it heats up to a steady 120°C for a duration of 15 minutes. It may be used like this twice a day, after which it regains use after touching the dawn light.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This dust looks grey when observed, as long as it is within its lead-lined pouch to insulate it from surrounding magics. This is often used by law enforcement to ascertain the nature of magic-based crimes.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a pinch of it is sprinkled in the air, the dust may absorb remmenants of magic from the surrounding area, to a range of 60 feet and hang in the air. The dust may turn one or many colours depending on the type of magic used in the area in the past, up to a limit of week-old remmanants.</p>

        <description>
            <p>These gloves have the spell equation of the cantrip Mage Hand within their lining. Professionals which work with substances which could be harmful if held directly usually use these gloves, such as alchemists or blacksmiths.</p>
            <p class="indent">As an action, the wearer may summon one or two <i>mage hands</i>. They have all the properties of the regular <i>mage hand</i> except for the fact that they have a range of 10 feet. They are also very cumbersome, and thus prevents weaponry or any objects larger than the size Tiny from being held. Dexterity checks for any hand-related movements have disadvantage when they are done with the gloves themselves.</p>
