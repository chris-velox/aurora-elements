            <p>You are skilled at traditional methods of hunting and trapping, gaining the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
                <li>You gain proficiency in Survival. If you’re already proficient in it, you gain expertise with it, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.</li>
                <li>You gain proficiency with nets, and when you use the Attack action and attack with a net, you can use a bonus action to attack with a one-handed weapon you are holding.

The target must succed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency bonus) or drop the object you choose. The object lands at its feet. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s holding the item with two or more hands.</li>
