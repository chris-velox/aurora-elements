            <p>You have developed a special transmutation cantrip, called Transmute Object. It requires verbal and somatic components, is cast as an action, and allows you to transmute a simple, mundane, nonliving Tiny object into another. For example, you could transmute a lantern into a broadsword.</p>
            <p class="indent">You know the cantrip, and it doesn’t count against your number of wizard cantrips known.</p>
