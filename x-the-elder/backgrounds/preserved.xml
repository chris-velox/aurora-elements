        <description>
            <p>You are from a distant place that transcends miles and even continents. You are from the past. You experienced a phenomenon that debarred you experiencing the regular passage of time. Although this new world initially made you distraught, you occasionally recognise echos from your past world surfacing in this new existence. You may have come to this period with or without reason, the likes of which you may or may not share with this strange new world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Talk to your DM about creating a period that would be fitting for you to have originated from. While you can choose any number of years to have been in stasis for, the recommended amount of years is between 100 and 1000.</p>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> History, Investigation </li>
                <li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Any one musical instrument or gaming set from your time of your choice, likely something considered a relic in the present</li>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> </li>
                <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A book that was preserved with you, a small hourglass, a set of dated common clothes and a pouch containing bygone coins worth 10 gp</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>STASIS</h5>
            <p>You began your life in a world long before the present day. A circumstance you experienced removed you from that world and sent you many years into the future, where you awoke in a world of unfamiliarity.</p>
            <p class="indent">While this circumstance may not have put you into stasis in the literal sense, it was analogous in its effect on your life. Choose or randomly determine the nature of your stasis.</p>

            <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
            <p>Most preserved find themselves struggling to fit into present society, justified by naivety or obstinance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sticking out like a sore thumb, most will attempt to integrate into this new society while some may denounce it daily.</p>
