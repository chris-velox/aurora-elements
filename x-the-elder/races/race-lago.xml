        <description>
            <p>The Lago are a race of rabbit-like humanoids. They live in underground communities, clans, and sometimes even cities, called Warrens. Warrens are highly organized and communal societies, with strict rules for the common good. Lago get along well with other races, particularly gnomes, dwarves, and elves. They are loyal and dedicated allies, taking duty and honor seriously, and are quick to aid others against enemies like orcs, kobolds, drow, and goblins. However, they are also reserved and secretive. To be invited into a Warren as a guest is the highest honor that Lago can bestow upon outsiders.</p>
            <p class="indent">Considered pessimistic by other races, Lago would argue that they simply believe in being prepared. They methodically plan for numerous potential dangers, and will patrol around Warrens for great distances. Due to their resourcefulness, Lago can live in all manner of climates and environments.</p>
            <h4>A LAGO ADVENTURER</h4>
            <p>For your backstory, consider why your Lago has left their Warren. Are they on a mission for the Warren? Do they long for freedom and independence? Have they been exiled? Will your Lago eventually return to the Warren or leave it forever?</p>
            <h4>LAGO NAMES</h4>
            <p>Lago names tend to be simple and nature-related. A Warren could be called River Den or Clover Hideout. Personal Names could be Songbird, Thistle, Marble, Walnut, or Icicle.</p>
