            <p class="flavor">I HAVE WATCHED PEOPLE LIE, CHEAT AND TRICK OTHERS for their own gain. I have watched how humanity turns against each other at the mer-est hint of provocation. I had lived most of my life more honest than humans and other races have been in a week. Yet I am the one ridiculed and hated for what I am. I have not deserved this hatred, but mark my words... I will ensure that I have earned it.</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">— Chryss, the Queen of Misery</p>
            <p>Most people don't even think about the presence of the faceless due to their alien nature. That's because their ties to the Far Realms gave them the ability to take on appearances of others. This is why they are generally greeted with suspicions and distrust. Well, that is, if they turn up in their true form...</p>
            <h4>HUNDREDS OF FACES</h4>
            <p>Faceless true forms share several physical characterstics regardless of their bloodline. Usually, faceless tend to have a slender build with height a little shorter than that of an average human. Their eyes are colorless, and their pale smooth skin is usually colored in some shade of gray, rarely showing a hint of blue, red, or another color. Their hair tends to be white or silver, often with a hue of another color like pink or gold. It's common for the faceless to also keep some characteristics of their ancestors from Material Plane, such as pointed ears of elven parents, stout figure of a dwarf, or tusks of an orc.</p>
            <p class="indent">Of course, none of this applies once the faceless turn into someone else. With their uncanny talent, they can take form of anyone they have seen or anyone they could could imagine.</p>
            <h4>QUICK TO CHANGE, SLOW TO DECIDE</h4>
            <p>Many would consider an ability to change their looks at any time a gift, but to the faceless it can seem at times like a curse. Due to fears of prejudice, many faceless spend little to no time in their true form. Some try to have an ordinary life, changing their form rarely. Others take full advantage of their powers, becoming infiltrators, thieves, blackmailers and spies. Yet, some faceless live in their true form, to show others that their kind could be trusted.</p>
            <p class="indent">Due to their chaotic nature, they change their moods as often as they change their appearance. It's not unusual for faceless to be indecisive and work on more than one task at a time. Their innate ability of changing gives them an uncanny ability to deceive others. Befriending a faceless could either be a blessing, or a disaster.</p>
            <h4>CONSTANT SEARCH</h4>
            <p>Touched by Far Realms, faceless feel a need to search something their whole life. This longing drives them, whether they seek their true self, forbidden knowledge, or their ancestor. When a faceless takes up adventuring, it might be to fulfill its need. Some get distracted on the way by the fame and fortune, but sooner or later their desire will resurface.</p>
            <h4>FACELESS NAMES</h4>
            <p>There are two kinds of faceless names, depending on the culture they're born into. Those born to non-faceless parents tend to have a name of a fitting culture. But within the faceless culture, it is a tradition to give short unisex names.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Unisex Names:</b> Alex, Ash, Bryn, Carol, Charlie, Chris, Dee, Fran, Gray, Haven, Jackie, Jess, Jo, Kit, Lee, Mel, Nat, Pat, Quinn, Sam, Steph, Val, Will</p>
