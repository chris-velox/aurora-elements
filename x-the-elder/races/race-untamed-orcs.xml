        <description>
            <p>Stuck between honor and savagery, orcs are a complicated and mostly misunderstood race that always lingers on the edge between noble barbarians and wild savages. Orc society is tribal by nature, rich with traditions, honorable, yet wild and untamed. They see the world for what it is: dangerous and wild, where only the strongest can survive. As such, orcs are focused on strength and survival, not to destroy, but to survive as an individual and as a race. They have seen civilizations rise and fall, but the orcs remain.</p>
            <p class="indent">Orc ethics may still vary greatly from tribe to tribe. Some are roaming the lands, taking what they need from whoever has it, others live by a strong code of honor and only fight worthy opponents, and even others tend to isolate themselves from other races by living in the harshest of lands as a test of their will and endurance.</p>
            <h4>Orc Traits</h4>
            <p>Your orc character has the following racial traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Orcs reach adulthood at age 13 and live up to 70 years.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> As varied as the orc tribes are their ethics and morals. However, most orcs have in common, that they see the world as a harsh and deadly place in which only the strongest are fit to survive. Therefore, most orcs are either neutral or evil, as helping the weak and unfortunate would mean disturbing the natural order.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Orcs are usually over 6 feet tall and weigh between 230 and 280 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Strong-Willed.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Survivor.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in the Survival skill.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Toughness.</em></strong> Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Three subraces of orcs are found among the worlds of the multiverse: black orcs, red orcs and grey orcs. These subraces usually form separated tribes, but several mixed tribes are known to exist. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
