        <description>
            <p>In bygone days, giants ruled the vast realm of Ostoria. Many humans swore fealty to them, and in return received the giants' boon.</p>
            <p class="indent">The descendants of these ancient humans, called giantkin, have since spread far and wide. Though as varied as their ancestors' patrons, all stand out for their towering stature.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>GIANTKIN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Your giantkin character has the following traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Either your Strength or Constitution score increases by 2, and the other by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Giantkin have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live under 100 years.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Some giantkin societies such as stonekin tend toward more lawful alignment, while others like hillkin lean toward independent, chaotic types. Most don't have strong tendencies toward good or evil.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Powerful Build.</em></strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>
