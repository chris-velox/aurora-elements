		<description>
            <p class="flavor">THE DRAGONBORN IN MY SERVICE ARE BUT PALE imitations of my draconic power, but they do have their uses. The fools are loyal to me despite the fact that I pit them against each other, father against son, mother against daughter. The cretins will do anything to win my favor, even sacrificing their own young is not out of the question.</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">They have been most useful in the elimination of rivals that would dare to enter my territory. In the days of my youth I would have greatly enjoyed the opportunity to test my might against another dragon, but now ...I have more important pursuits to attend to. The ferocity of my dragonborn minions in battle is unmatched, and once given orders, they would rather die in the attempt then return to me unsuccessful. They are a swarm that washes over their enemies, a whirlwind of chromatic and metallic scales, destroying all that stand against them.</p>
            <p class="flavor" style="text-align:right;">-Malactus the Noxious, Ancient Green Dragon</p>
            <p>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>
            <h4>PROUD DRAGON KIN</h4>
            <p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talon-like claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p>
            <p class="indent">The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor— bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</p>
            <h4>SELF-SUFFICIENT CLANS</h4>
            <p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p>
            <p class="indent">A continual drive for self improvement reflects the self sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p>
            <h4>DRAGONBORN NAMES</h4>
            <p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Personal Names.</em></strong> Arjhan, Balasar, Bharash, Donaar, Ghesh, Heskan, Kriv, Medrash, Mehen, Nadarr, Pandjed, Patrin, Rhogar, Shamash, Shedinn, Tarhun, Torinn</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Clan Names.</em></strong> Clethtinthiallor, Daardendrian, Delmirev, Drachedandion, Fenkenkabradon, Kepeshkmolik, Kerrhylon, Kimbatuul, Linxakasendalor, Myastan, Nemmonis, Norixius, Ophinshtalajiir, Prexijandilin, Shestendeliath, Turnuroth, Verthisathurgiesh, Yarjerit</p>
            <h4>DRAGONBORN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength increases by 2.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Young dragonborn grow quickly. They reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with Tiamat can be terrible villains.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> Your skin is tough and scaly. When you’re not wearing armor your AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and still gain these benefits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Draconic Ancestry.</em></strong> You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">DRACONIC ANCESTRY</h5>
            <table>

            </table>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Damage Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> There are two subraces of dragonborn, those that embrace the bestial side of their heritage, the Feral Dragonborn, and those that lean towards their wise ancestry, the Regal Dragonborn.</p>

                <p>Dragonborn that were brought up to embrace their ferocious and animalistic side are called Feral.

                    <p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use one of your attacks to exhale destructive energy of your Draconic Ancestry damage type. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in a 15 ft. cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

            <p class="flavor">PAUL RIVERS ENLISTED IN THE TOWN GUARD THE day he turned eighteen. Nobody thought that this was an especially good idea, but no one had the heart to turn the boy away. After all, the village hadn’t been attacked by monsters in almost ten summers. Paul trained with the rest of the town guard, and despite his naive personality, he found himself a natural with the sword and spear. Over the next few months he grew in skill and strength, and by the following summer, Paul could best any warrior in the village.</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">Just before harvest time, a group of evil cultists descended upon the village. They stole everything of value, and burned anything they couldn’t steal. At the towns most desperate moment, when the remaining survivors cowered in the armory, the cult’s champion issued a challenge. A duel to the death for the lives of the remaining villagers. Without a word, Paul drew his sword and stepped forward.</p>
            <p class="flavor" style="text-align: right;">-Berthold Cornersnatch, Traveling Bard and Storyteller</p>
            <p>In most settings, humans are the most numerous of the mortal races. Their adaptability as a people allows them to live comfortably in all but the most hostile environments, and they can be found in almost any city, village, or hamlet. Humans tend to live in large social groups, and most in permanent settlements.</p>
            <p class="indent">Because of their versatility, humans vary wildly based on their surroundings. Where they live, their occupation, the climate, their level of education, and other daily influences all have an effect on their skills and traits. It is hard to make generalizations about humans as the only thing that humans have in common is their ability to change and adapt to the problem at hand.</p>
            <h4>DIVERSITY</h4>
            <p>Unlike most races in <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, humans value diversity. They welcome new ideas and improvements and are accepting of any who wish to contribute to the common good. Due to their versatility, humans are capable of conceiving viable offspring with most other humanoid creatures, and their acceptance of these "half-humans" in their communities is an exception when compared to the other races like Elves and Orcs.</p>
            <p class="indent">Because of their comparably shorter lifespans, humans from different regions can vary wildly. The wispy, well educated, scholar from the university of a large city, and the muscular nomadic tribesman from the wintry north could have a common relative as close as two generations back.</p>
            <h4>IMPROVISE. ADAPT. OVERCOME.</h4>
            <p>When a human wants to succeed at something, there is almost nothing in the world that can stop them. Their ability to overcome obstacles is second to none. Due to their relatively short lifespans, humans are extremely driven to leave their mark on the world.</p>
            <p class="indent">Their natural talents and adaptability allow them to rival elvish archmages in arcane skill, orcish prowess in battle, or the craftsmanship of dwarven elders. When a human dedicates themselves to a cause, they mean to see it through to the end.</p>
            <h4>HUMAN NAMES</h4>
            <p>Humans names, like their other traits, depend on where they were born. Humans tend to borrow names from other cultures and races that they work closely with.</p>
            <h4>HUMAN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>It’s hard to generalize about humans, as the best and worst are found among them. However, no matter their upbringing, humans always set lofty goals for their lives. Maybe in the face of such long lived races they feel they need to make a larger impact in their comparatively short time. Whatever their motivations, human adventurers often become larger then life figures due to their perseverance and grit in the face of adversity. All humans have the following traits in common.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and usually live less then a century.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and worst are found among every human culture.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Humans vary wildly in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 ft.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Determination.</em></strong> When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can do so with advantage. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> There are three main subraces of humans, but they more closely represent their upbringing: astute, generalist, and vigorous. Choose one of these subraces.</p>

		<description>
            <p class="flavor">PALEFANG STEPPED FORWARD INTO THE circle that was already forming around him. He had left the village two moons ago as a hatchling, determined to return and prove his strength. He now sought to challenge the aging chieftain for his position as leader of the clan. The rival lizardfolk he had slain earlier that day had strengthened his Ma’Ko enough that the chieftain did not think it disgraceful to accept his challenge. If he won, Palefang would wrest control of the clan, and the other hatchlings would be forced to respect him. As the circle of lizardfolk closed around him and the chieftain, Palefang drew his bone dagger. The chieftain let out a low hiss and dropped his cloak from his shoulders, revealing a battle-hardened body covered in scales and scars. The noise of the tribe grew louder and louder in his ears, and for the first time in a long time, Palefang knew fear.</p>
            <p class="flavor" style="text-align: right;">-Captain Rufus Hogback, Retired Adventurer</p>
            <p>Deep in the great tropical jungles and swamps of the world dwell an ancient race of people, the lizardfolk. Though their ways have remained unchanged for eons, their ferocity in battle and ingenuity make up for their lack of technological advancement.</p>
            <p class="indent">Covered from head to tail in thick scales of various shades of green, grey, and brown, Lizardfolk easily blend in with their natural habitat, making them excellent natural hunters. Their fanged maw and sharp claw make them dangerous foes, even when unarmed. From their hardy bodies and naturally tough scales, all lizarfolk, no matter their tribe, are hard to take down when they want to survive.</p>

                <h5 class="caption">MISUNDERSTOOD MONSTERS?</h5>
                <p>In most <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> settings, lizardfolk are considered horrible monsters. The alternate lizardfolk presented here attempts to give some more depth to one of the more iconic monsters in the world’s greatest role-playing game.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>TRIBAL WARRIORS</h4>
            <p>Lizardfolk are a people unlike any other; feeling no emotions, yet fiercely loyal to their small tribes. Their need to prove themselves in battle makes them dangerous neighbors, and they are constantly involved in tribal warfare. Their bloody lifestyle, and culture of war has prevented them from advancing past their primitive ways.</p>
            <p class="indent">Unlike most humaniods, they do not form familial bonds, instead, they all do what is best for the benefit of their tribe. Hatchlings are a precious commodity that are looked after by the entire tribe. The females that lay the clutches of eggs view all of the hatchlings as their children.</p>
            <p class="indent">Due to their animalistic and aggressive way of life, most, if not all, lizardfolk tribes are ruled by one chieftain. Usually they are the strongest warrior, but it is not unusual for them to be ruled by a wise druid or powerful shaman.</p>
            <h4>THE ENERGY OF LIFE: MA’KO</h4>
            <p>Lizardfolk society is governed by the principle of Ma’Ko, or life energy. Lizardfolk gain Ma’Ko by overcoming enemies that are their equal or better. They have no interest in fighting those that they see as weaker then themselves, and they will stop at nothing to test their mettle against powerful foes.</p>
            <p class="indent">Lizardfolk view their lives, and all of their actions, through this lens. After they hatch, they have one year to accomplish enough great deeds to be considered an adult member of the tribe. If they fail to meet this expectation they are exiled from the tribe or killed in honor duels by their clutchmates.</p>
            <p class="indent">In order to become the chieftan of a Lizardfolk tribe, you must have, and maintain, the most Ma’Ko. Rivals of the current chieftan will go out into the wilds to find powerful foes to defeat, and return to challenge the leader in one-on-one combat.</p>
            <h4>LIZARDFOLK NAMES</h4>
            <p>Lizardfolk hatchlings are named for their physical characteristics. Lizardfolk keep this name until they are recognized as a full member of the tribe. If they survive to adulthood they are given a new name based on how they won their Ma’Ko. Adult lizardfolk may take new names as they accomplish greater feats and conquer more dangerous foes.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hatchling Names.</em></strong> Blackclaw, Dreadspine, Greenscale, Heavystep, Longtooth, Quickfinn, Rotfang, Widemaw.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Adult Names.</em></strong> Bonecrusher, Firewalker, Heartsplitter, Kingbreaker, Lightthief, Trollslayer, Wyrmeater.</p>
            <h5>A VIOLENT UPBRINGING</h5>
            <p class="indent">Hatchlings are protected by the tribe from the dangers of the swamps and jungles they live in. Despite that protection, the most dangerous year of a Lizardfolk’s life is its first one. Hatchlings will do anything to gain the Ma’Ko necessary to be fully accepted into their tribe. In their desperation, they will kill and cannabalize their clutchmates without a second thought.</p>
            <h4>LIZARDFOLK TRAITS</h4>
            <p class="indent">Lizardfolk have many innate abilities derived from centuries spent warring among each other and defending themselves from the threats present in the jungles and swamps where they make their home.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution increases by 2.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Lizardfolk reach maturity around 1 year of age and rarely live longer than 60 years.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Most lizardfolk are neutral. They see the world as a place of predators and prey.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Lizardfolk are a little bulkier and taller than humans, and their colorful frills can make them seem even larger. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. You deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cunning Artisan.</em></strong> As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can still use a shield and gain the benefits of this trait.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hungry Jaws.</em></strong> In battle, you can throw yourself into a vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points (minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can’t use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You speak Draconic and Common</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> There are four main subraces of lizardfolk: Amphibious, Chameleon, Frilled, and Komodo. Choose one of these subraces.</p>

                <p>The most numerous type of lizardfolk are those that live in and around bodies of water. They are a peaceable people who will only fight when it is necessary for their survival. They spend most of their days floating about underwater, waiting for an unsuspecting small animal to swim by. They snap their prey up in an instant and sink back into the water to enjoy their meal. Amphibious lizardfolk form small bands that come together during the full moon to take care of tribe business.</p>
