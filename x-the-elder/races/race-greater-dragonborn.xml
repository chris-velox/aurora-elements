        <description>
            <p>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>
            <p class="indent">The blood of a particular type of dragon runs strong through all dragonborn. A dragonborn’s color imparts many traits upon them, including varying types of breath weapon, as well as scales that closely match those of their dragon ancestor --- bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</p>
            <h4>GREATER DRAGONBORN TRAITS</h4>
            <p>Your draconic identity manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn, as well as unique aspects based on your color.</p>
            <h4>DRAGONBORN NAMES</h4>
            <p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor. A childhood name or nickname is often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of endearment. The name might recall an event or center on a habit.</p>
            <p>

                <br/>
                <b>Childhood Names: </b>Climber, Earbender, Leaper, Pious, Shieldbiter, Zealous
                <br/>

                <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="feature">Age.</span>
                Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>
                Dragonborn tend to extremes, with chromatic dragonborn taking on their ancestor’s cruelty and malice, while metallic dragonborn follow ideals of benevolence and justice.
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Size.</span>
                Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Speed.</span>
                Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Natural Armor.</span>
                You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Breath Weapon.</span>
                You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.
                <br />When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 17th level.
                <br />After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Languages.</span>
                You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
                <br />
                <span class="feature">Colors.</span>
                In the same manner as true dragons, dragonborn are divided into a number of different colors. These colors fall into two categories, the chromatics --- black, blue, green, red, and white --- and the metallics --- brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver.
