            <p>Some aasimar are born of celestial entities that are less concerned with rigid order or chaotic freedom, instead working to find a middle ground between the two. Their offspring are healers and warriors, leaders unafraid of either welcoming a friend with open arms or taking war to a foe.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Trance.</em></strong> You don't need to sleep. Instead, you meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefits that most people do from 8 hours of sleep. This replaces your healing hands racial feature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Cosmic Shape.</em></strong> Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing powerful magical arms to unfold from your back. As your power increases, more pairs of arms can be manifested at once. These arms have two abilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Peace.</i> Upon using this ability you can counteract the harm in a creature's past and guard it from pain in the future. For each pair of magical arms you have, you gain a pool of 5 points of healing energy and 5 temporary hit points. As a bonus action, you can transfer an equal number of each to a creature within 10 feet of you. Once the energy from this pool has been spent, it is not regained till after a long rest.</li>
                <li><i>War.</i> Each of your hands holds an incorporeal weapon or strikes with metaphysical force. Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature with an attack action or spell, you can strike at the same creature again with your magical hands, each pair causing 4 points of force damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Magical arms cannot be used to do anything else that would require any kind of action, nor do they give a bonus to any ability scores or checks. Your natural arms do not count towards the total when calculating healing, temporary hit points, or damage. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you use a bonus action to end it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

                <p>Balance aasimar are descended from unnamed neutral good celestials rather than the lawful good angels of Mount Celestia. While I have not designed any celestial creatures to serve as their guides, the good supernatural beings of Hindu/Vedic religious stories (my inspiration for balance aasimar) are where the term deva comes from in the first place. Your angelic guide can use the same stats if needed, you would simply change the alignment and make some changes to the appearance and name. For example, instead of Barachiel the golden angel, you'd have Abhidyu, a four-armed deva.</p>
