        <description>
            <p>The tattooed elf stands victorious over the body of a newly slain frost giant, his axes dripping with blood and the runes marking his body glowing after having deflected the giant’s brutal assault. He raises his axes and shouts a victorious cry. The low crash of thunder can be heard in the distance. The gods are pleased.</p>
            <p class="indent">The red-haired genasi hammers away at a beautifully crafted sword. The snow flurries around him as he thrusts the sword into his forge. He takes it out to examine the carved rune, glowing with blue light. It hums with anticipation.</p>
            <p class="indent">The young human pants as he reaches the top of the lone mountain. He looks around, the cursed wood stretching as far as the eye could see. He breathes the cold, brisk morning air and sits down to watch the sun rise. Here he would sit until the secrets of the universe revealed themselves. And he would not leave until he knew why they had wronged him.</p>
            <p class="indent">Warrior, soldier, pirate, or hermit, a true Viking is defined by their knowledge of the runes that embody all aspects of the universe. Vikings are skilled fighters who weave aspects of the runes into their martial prowess to gain an advantage in battle.</p>
            <h4>RUNIC WARRIORS</h4>
            <p>Runes embody all aspects of the universe. Vikings study these runes and their aspects to gain an edge in battle. A Viking can utter runes in the midst of combat to harness elements through Isaz and Kenaz, or imbue her weapon with power through Berkanan. They can also be used outside of battle. A trained Viking can harness sustenance from runes and never go hungry or thirsty so long as he remembers Fehu or Laguz.</p>
            <h4>PEOPLE OF VOYAGE AND WINTER</h4>
            <p>Vikings hail from cold, frigid climates. Their homelands are generally sprawling plains and forests, littered with ancient mountain ranges. Their people farm and trade, but they themselves train for and go on seafaring expeditions, usually in order to raid coastal villages and towns for goods. A viking’s goal is to die in battle in order to join their gods. They generally believe in some form of final battle that they will all take part in.</p>
            <p class="indent">However, the way a viking chooses to go about that is different from individual to individual. Perhaps they choose to wait it out and hone their skills until the time is right, or they choose a life of adventure, knowing full well that something out there will be the end of them. The way they live is up to them and them alone. But the way of their death, they believe, is in the hands of Fate, and that is where it will stay.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A VIKING</h4>
            <p>An important aspect of creating a Viking is to determine their combat expertise. Do you want to create a frontline berserker that can soak up hits from enemies and protects allies via a shield? Or do you want to play a versatile, druidic warrior that uses runes to regularly enhance their combat ability as well as everyday life?</p>
            <p class="indent">How did your viking come to learn the runes? Was it through months and years of study? Or was it a revelation from your gods, found in the aftermath of a bloody battle, or perhaps on a lone mountaintop after days of contemplation?</p>
            <p class="indent">Most importantly, however, is how you choose to harness these newfound runes. Do you paint and scar your body with the runes as a reminder of your accomplishment? Do you etch them on your blades and hammers to show proudly? Or perhaps you stick to uttering them, and instead spend your time unlocking more of the universe’s secrets. After all, there are always more to be found.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can build a Viking quickly after following these suggestions. First, strength should be your highest score, followed by constitution, or wisdom if you plan to choose the Font of the Noose. Second, choose the soldier background. Third, pick the Isaz, Kenaz, and Berkanan runes.</p>

To cast one of these spells you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <h5>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher</h5>
                <p>You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice.</p>
                <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Font of the Noose Spellcasting table shows when you learn more druid spells of 1st-level or higher. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <p class="indent">Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the druid spells you know with another spell of your choice from the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
                <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. You use your Wisdom modifier whenever a spell refers to your spellcastng ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
                <p class="indent"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
