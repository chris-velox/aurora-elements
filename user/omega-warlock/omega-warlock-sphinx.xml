            <p>You have made your pact with a sphinx, a creature as powerful as it is inscrutable. Unflinching guardians of divine treasures, from temples to enchanted artifacts, as well as living repositories of lore and ancient knowledge, sphinxes desire only to fulfill their divinely appointed missions.</p>
            <p class="indent">Bound eternally to a single place of stewardship, some sphinxes choose to cede fractions of power to mortals, empowering them to act as their agents in the world abroad.</p>
