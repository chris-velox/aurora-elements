            <p>You have made a pact with an archdevil from the depths of hell, a being bound by its word and stature. Devils spend their lives making deals, granting power for service, goods, or most commonly souls. Signing a contract with a devil is not as straight forward as it does seem, even with all the words in front of you they can be twisted to mean something completely different, something devils have spent their entire existence perfecting.</p>
