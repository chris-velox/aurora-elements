            <p>Sparks fly from your fingertips, shocking a creature within range. If the target is unconscious and reduced to 0 hit points, they gain advantage on their next death saving throw, and any ability check made to aid them also gains advantage. If you target a hostile creature, they must make a Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they take 1d8 lightning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>
