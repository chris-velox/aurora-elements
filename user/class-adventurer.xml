            <p class="flavor">version 2.2.1</p>
            <p class="indent">A band of fellows emerge from the stony outcropping onto rolling plains of golden grass. Worn and weary from their travels, they settle against the rocks, taking a moment to breath.</p>
            <p class="indent">A rustling in the grass shakes the travelers out of their reverie. A bull with metal-like plating emerges, breathing green flames from its nostrils. The fellows scramble to arms, one human grabbing his mace, and an elf her staff.</p>
            <h4>CALL TO ADVENTURE</h4>
            <p>Adventurers leave home as any ordinary person would, but pick up skills on the road. Initially unskilled and untrained in everything, adventurers can take the time to become experts in a single field, or otherwise diversify and become a jack of all trades.</p>
            <h4>LIFE OF ROAMING</h4>
            <p>Adventurers often are far from home, out saving the world or doing new things.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ADVENTURER</h4>
            <p>Think about what your adventure requires, and adapt as necessary. Be sure your DM allows use of feats, as they are <b>required</b> for playing this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">This class is not designed for multiclassing, and should not be multiclassed. This class may not be perfectly balanced against other classes, and is best run in a party consisting only of adventurers.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>Try not to get choice paralysis. If you wish to emulate a certain class, take feats in an order that follows that classes natural progression.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an class, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per class level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per class level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <p>You are proficient with <b>nothing</b> except for any proficiencies provided by your race or background.</p>
            <p class="indent">You must pick up armor, weapon, tool, skill, and saving throw proficiencies through feats.</p>
            <h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the equipment provided by your background, as well as 4d4 x 10 gp to buy your own equipment.</p>
