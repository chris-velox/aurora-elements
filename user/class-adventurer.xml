            <p class="flavor">version 2.3.0</p>
            <p class="indent">A band of fellows emerge from the stony outcropping onto rolling plains of golden grass. Worn and weary from their travels, they settle against the rocks, taking a moment to breath.</p>
            <p class="indent">A rustling in the grass shakes the travelers out of their reverie. A bull with metal-like plating emerges, breathing green flames from its nostrils. The fellows scramble to arms, one human grabbing his mace, and an elf her staff.</p>
            <h4>CALL TO ADVENTURE</h4>
            <p>Adventurers leave home as any ordinary person would, but pick up skills on the road. Initially unskilled and untrained in everything, adventurers can take the time to become experts in a single field, or otherwise diversify and become a jack of all trades.</p>
            <h4>LIFE OF ROAMING</h4>
            <p>Adventurers often are far from home, out saving the world or doing new things.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ADVENTURER</h4>
            <p>Think about what your adventure requires, and adapt as necessary. Be sure your DM allows use of feats, as they are <b>required</b> for playing this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">This class is not designed for multiclassing, and should not be multiclassed. This class may not be perfectly balanced against other classes, and is best run in a party consisting only of adventurers.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>Try not to get choice paralysis. If you wish to emulate a certain class, take feats in an order that follows that class’ natural progression. If you wish to emulate another fictional character, consider their abilities and try to plan out some of the key feats you may want.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an class, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per class level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per class level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <p>You are proficient with <b>nothing</b> except for any proficiencies provided by your race or background.</p>
            <p class="indent">You must pick up armor, weapon, tool, skill, and saving throw proficiencies through feats.</p>
            <h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the equipment provided by your background, as well as 4d4 x 10 gp to buy your own equipment.</p>

            <p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
                <li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.</li>
                <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
                <li>If an effect causes you to suffer levels of exhaustion, you aren’t affected until your rage ends.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged 2 times, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can select this feat a second time after 3rd level, a third time after 7th level, a fourth time after 11th level, and a fifth time after 15th level. Each time, you can select a damage type to also be resistant to while raging. Your bonus damage and number of rages also increase by 1, to a maximum of +6 damage and 6 rages per long rest.</p>

                <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creatures, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>
                <li>When you transform, you assume the creatures’s hit points. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>
                <li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your new form. If your new form is capable of casting spells, you are unable to cast any of them. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell.</li>
                <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
                <li>If your new form has legendary actions or legendary resistances, you cannot use them.</li>
                <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>
            </ul>

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.</p>

            <p>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes. You gain 4 ki points, which you regain when you finish a short or long rest, and you gain the following benefits while you are unarmed. If you have the Tavern Brawler feat, you can gain these benefits while holding an improvised weapon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.</li>
                <li>Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage. This dice size increases if you select this feat again.</li>
                <li>When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action, or you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</li>
                <li>You can spend 1 ki point to use your reaction to deflect the weapon or missile when you are hit by a melee or ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d4 + your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. This dice size increases if you select this feat again.</li>
                <li>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Some abilities tied to Martial Arts require your target to make a saving throw to resist. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <center>
            <p><strong>Ki Save DC</strong> = 8 + your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus</p>
            </center>
            <p class="indent">You can select this feat a second time after 5th level, a third time after 11th level, and a fourth time after 17th level. Each time you do so you gain 4 additional ki points and you can replace the damage of your unarmed strike and the reduction from weapon deflection with a die one step larger (such as from 1d4 to 1d6). If you have the Tavern Brawler feat, you can replace the damage of your unarmed strike with a die one step larger. This does not affect your deflection die.</p>

You can extend this duration by 24 hours by expending 1 additional ki point when you use this feature. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki Save DC. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Prerequisite: 1st-Level Spellcasting</p>
            <p>Select a school of magic from the following list: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. You gain a spellbook containing three 1st-level spells from your chosen school. You gain the ability to use your spellbook as your spellcasting focus. Cantrips cannot be recorded in a spellbook. If you have a spellbook from another feat such as Ritual Caster, you can use the same book for both feats.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Preparing Spells.</em></strong> You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your spellcasting modifier + your proficiency bonus (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Copying a Spell into the Book.</em></strong> When you find a spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level you can cast and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">A spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Replacing the Book.</em></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, it may be wise to keep a backup spellbook in a safe place.</p>

This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it as a bonus action. While you’re in the disguise, you gain access to all information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance such as general details on its background and personal life. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories. Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check.</p>

At the end of your turn, the wings disappear and you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

If you do so and hold a nonmagical item throughout the casting, you cast the spell, but none of the spell’s effects occur. Instead, the spell transfers into that item for later use if the item doesn’t already contain a spell from this feature. Any creature holding the item thereafter can use an action to activate the spell if the creature has an Intelligence score of at least 6.</p>

Both your familiar and the creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. Your familiar must be a fiend in order to use this ability. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

                <p class="flavor">Prerequisite: Infused Magic, 19th Level</p>
                <p>You learn to use your skill to create a clockwork servant. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 100 gp worth of metal components, you can create a clockwork servant. You can only have one clockwork servant at a time. Your servant can take the form of any beast of CR 1/2. The servant uses that beast’s game statistics, but it can look however you like, as long as its form is appropriate for its statistics. It has the following modifications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is a construct instead of a beast.</li>
                    <li>It is immune to psychic and poison damage and the poisoned and charmed conditions.</li>
                    <li>It gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet if it doesn’t have it already.</li>
                    <li>It understands the languages you can speak when you create it, but it can’t speak.</li>
                    <li>It is unaffected by healing magic. If is targeted by the mending spell, it can spend hit dice and instead use the highest number possible for each die.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="indent">Your servant acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn.</p>
                <p class="indent">You can infuse a spell into your servant through use of the Infused Magic feat. As an action, your servant can activate the spell, even if it has an Intelligence score of less than 6. Your servant be infused with only one spell at a time.</p>
                <p class="indent">If your servant is destroyed, you can spend 8 hours of work and 100 gp worth of metal components in order to repair the servant. You can only have one clockwork servant at a time.</p>
