            <p class="flavor">version 2.3.0</p>
            <p class="indent">A band of fellows emerge from the stony outcropping onto rolling plains of golden grass. Worn and weary from their travels, they settle against the rocks, taking a moment to breath.</p>
            <p class="indent">A rustling in the grass shakes the travelers out of their reverie. A bull with metal-like plating emerges, breathing green flames from its nostrils. The fellows scramble to arms, one human grabbing his mace, and an elf her staff.</p>
            <h4>CALL TO ADVENTURE</h4>
            <p>Adventurers leave home as any ordinary person would, but pick up skills on the road. Initially unskilled and untrained in everything, adventurers can take the time to become experts in a single field, or otherwise diversify and become a jack of all trades.</p>
            <h4>LIFE OF ROAMING</h4>
            <p>Adventurers often are far from home, out saving the world or doing new things.</p>
            <h4>CREATING AN ADVENTURER</h4>
            <p>Think about what your adventure requires, and adapt as necessary. Be sure your DM allows use of feats, as they are <b>required</b> for playing this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">This class is not designed for multiclassing, and should not be multiclassed. This class may not be perfectly balanced against other classes, and is best run in a party consisting only of adventurers.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>Try not to get choice paralysis. If you wish to emulate a certain class, take feats in an order that follows that class' natural progression. If you wish to emulate another fictional character, consider their abilities and try to plan out some of the key feats you may want.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an class, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
            <ul class="unstyled">
                <li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d8 per class level</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier</li>
                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per class level after 1st</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
            <p>You are proficient with <b>nothing</b> except for any proficiencies provided by your race or background.</p>
            <p class="indent">You must pick up armor, weapon, tool, skill, and saving throw proficiencies through feats.</p>
            <h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the equipment provided by your background, as well as 4d4 x 10 gp to buy your own equipment.</p>

            <p>You gain the ability to use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this ability twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. You can transform into beasts of CR 1/4. The creatures cannot have a flying or swimming speed. You can stay in a beast shape for thirty minutes. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this ability. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creatures, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</li>
                <li>When you transform, you assume the creatures's hit points. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</li>
                <li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your new form. If your new form is capable of casting spells, you are unable to cast any of them. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell.</li>
                <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
                <li>If your new form has legendary actions or legendary resistances, you cannot use them.</li>
                <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>

As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.</p>

            <p>Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes. You gain 4 ki points, which you regain when you finish a short or long rest, and you gain the following benefits while you are unarmed. If you have the Tavern Brawler feat, you can gain these benefits while holding an improvised weapon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.</li>
                <li>Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage. This dice size increases if you select this feat again.</li>
                <li>When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action, or you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</li>
                <li>You can spend 1 ki point to use your reaction to deflect the weapon or missile when you are hit by a melee or ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d4 + your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. This dice size increases if you select this feat again.</li>
                <li>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">Some abilities tied to Martial Arts require your target to make a saving throw to resist. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <center>
            <p><strong>Ki Save DC</strong> = 8 + your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus</p>
            </center>
            <p class="indent">You can select this feat a second time after 5th level, a third time after 11th level, and a fourth time after 17th level. Each time you do so you gain 4 additional ki points and you can replace the damage of your unarmed strike and the reduction from weapon deflection with a die one step larger (such as from 1d4 to 1d6). If you have the Tavern Brawler feat, you can replace the damage of your unarmed strike with a die one step larger. This does not affect your deflection die.</p>

        <description>
            <p class="flavor">Prerequisite: 1st-Level Spellcasting</p>
            <p>Select a school of magic from the following list: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. You gain a spellbook containing three 1st-level spells from your chosen school. You gain the ability to use your spellbook as your spellcasting focus. Cantrips cannot be recorded in a spellbook. If you have a spellbook from another feat such as Ritual Caster, you can use the same book for both feats.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Preparing Spells.</em></strong> You prepare the list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of spells from your spellbook equal to your spellcasting modifier + your proficiency bonus (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Copying a Spell into the Book.</em></strong> When you find a spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level you can cast and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>
            <p class="indent">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">A spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Replacing the Book.</em></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another bookâ€”for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, it may be wise to keep a backup spellbook in a safe place.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you must choose a different school of magic.</p>

The ward starts with hit points equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier which you chose for 1st-Level Spellcasting. If your Arcane Ward is dispelled or disabled in some other way, you must finish a long rest until you can cast it again.</p>

            <p>You can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major Transformation.</strong> You can transmute one nonmagical object (no larger than a 5-foot cube) into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to transform it.</li>
                <li><strong>Panacea.</strong> You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains all its hit points.</li>
                <li><strong>Restore Life.</strong> You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.</li>
                <li><strong>Restore Youth.</strong> You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.</li>

            <p>When you take this feat, choose two tricks. When you fulfill the criteria for Sneak Attack, you can apply one of these tricks. You can only apply one trick to a single attack, unless otherwise stated. Some of your tricks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the trick's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
            <center>
            <p><strong>Trick Save DC</strong> = 8 + Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Purloin.</em></strong> You can forgo 1 Sneak Attack dice on a melee attack to make a Sleight of Hand check against the target's armor class.

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fake Out.</em></strong> You can forgo half of your Sneak Attack dice, rounded down, on a melee or ranged weapon attack. Your next attack on this turn can benefit from your Sneak Attack, dealing damage equal to number of dice forgone.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Heel Cutter.</em></strong> You can forgo 1 Sneak Attack dice on a melee or ranged weapon attack. The target's movement speed decreases by 5 feet until the start of your next turn. You can apply this trick to the same attack multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Wing Clip.</em></strong> You can forgo 1 Sneak Attack dice on a ranged weapon attack against a target with a fly speed granted by natural wings. The target must make a Strength saving throw or plummet 10 feet. You can apply this trick to the same attack multiple times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Blindside.</em></strong> You can forgo 5 of your Sneak Attack dice on a melee or ranged weapon attack. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or become blinded. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Daze.</em></strong> You can forgo 5 of your Sneak Attack dice on a melee or ranged weapon attack. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.</p>

                <li>You can use the two-handed damage while using the weapon in one hand.</li>
                <li>On your turn, you can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action. If the unarmed strike hits the target, you have advantage on the next weapon attack you make at that target before the end of your turn.</li>

            <p>You gain the ability to channel your spells into objects for later use. When you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can increase its casting time to 1 minute. If you do so and hold a nonmagical item throughout the casting, you cast the spell, but none of the spell's effects occur. Instead, the spell transfers into that item for later use if the item doesn't already contain a spell from this feature. Any creature holding the item thereafter can use an action to activate the spell if the creature has an Intelligence score of at least 6.</p>
            <p class="indent">When activated, the spell is cast using your spellcasting ability, targeting the creature that activates the item. If the spell targets more than one creature, the creature that activates the item selects the additional targets. If the spell has an area of effect, it is centered on the item. If the spell's range is self, it targets the creature that activates the item. If the spell requires concentration, the creature that activates the item must concentrate on it.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you infuse a spell in this way, it must be used within 8 hours. After that time, its magic fades and is wasted. You can have a limited number of infused spells at the same time. The number equals your spellcasting modifier.</p>
