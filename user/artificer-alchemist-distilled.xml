        <description>
            <p>At 3rd level, you have constructed a widget with intricate cavities in which reagents can reside within.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you acquire a potion or a poison, you can use your alchemist’s supplies to split it into 10 parts. These widgets contain an invigorated yet less potent version of the original potion or poison called a fluid. The widget works as housing that administers the fluid in specific ways.</p>
            <p class="indent">The fluid does not need to be ingested. It can now be administered in alternativeways, depending on the widget. When applied,the fluid starts its effects immediately. If the fluid has an instantaneous effect, it is only applied once. If it has a duration, it is reduced to 1 minute. Any dice that you need to roll for a fluid is totalled then halved.</p>
            <p class="indent">The fluid’s duration does not exceed 1 minute, if you subject a creature multiple times to a fluid, the duration is only refreshed. If a fluid has its own DC from the previous potion or poison, you ignore it and instead use the DC from the widget. If the widget has no DC, you use the regular DC. The fluid otherwise obeys all the usual rules it would entail.</p>
            <p class="indent">Choose one of the widgets listed below. Once you choose your widget, you cannot change it or choose another. You can create 10 widgets from one potion or poison per short rest.</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">YOU AND YOUR WIDGET</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">Similar to a fighting style, your widget dictates your playstyle for the entirety of your artificer’s career. It makes opportunities for particular playstyles as well as section off playstyles you could have had. And just like a fighting style, once chosen, you can’t chane it for a new one. Your artificer has dedicated a lot of time and research into your chosen widget and cannot just swap it on a whim. Look into each widget and which one fits you. </p>
            <p class="flavor indent">Do you want to stay in the back, firing healing syringes into your allies? Making clouds of toxic fog that poisons enemies but heals allies? Or perhaps be on the front line, dissolving armour with your corrosive sword?</p>

                <p>Choose from a bottle, vial or a flask to situate an atomizer inside the neck of the canister. As an action, you can activate then throw this canister, kick-starting it upon impact with a surface. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the canister as an Improvised Weapon.</p>
                <p class="indent">Upon activation, the canister will start to churn out the contents as a fog-like mist in a 5ft spherical zone originating from the canister that expands to a 10ft radius after one round. Creatures that start their turn within this sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be subjected to the fluid’s effects. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled potions, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. The instance of the fluid starts instantly, the duration only begins to count down when a creature is no longer within the zone. Re-entering the zone refreshes this duration back to 1 minute.</p>
                <p class="indent">After 1 minute, the zone disperses. If the canister is moved before that time, it creates a new instance of the zone. This new zone also needs to expand similar to before, lasting for the remainder of the previous minute duration. The former zone lingers then expires one round later. This widget does not work underwater. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) will make the zone unable to expand past a 5ft radius. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) will cause the canister unable to produce a usable zone at all.</p>

Creatures within 10ft of the gun are not subjected to the fluid’s effects but instead are inflicted with the bullet’s usual damage. Creatures within the cone must succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be subjected to the potion or poison effects along with 1d4 piercing damage. Creatures behind cover or other creatures are not subjected to the fluid’s effects.</p>
                <p class="indent">The fluid coated shrapnel stay inside the skin of the creature and can’t be removed without the aid of a healer’s kit. The cone disperses immediately after detonating and does not linger. When used, these bullets cannot be recovered from the battlefield.</p>

                <p>Your bullet fires an enzyme that is super aggressive against nonliving matter but safe to the touch. Non-magical objects that aren’t being carried or worn (except shields) that is within the 15ft cone are slowly corroded away. Total cover becomes three-quarters, three-quarters becomes half and half is broken apart. If a creature’s shield is covered in this acid, it consecutively loses 1 AC every 2 rounds. They must spend an action to wipe away the acid before the end of the 4th round. If they fail to do this, the shield becomes too broken to use.</p>
