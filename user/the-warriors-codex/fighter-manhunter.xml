            <p>Warriors and trackers, manhunters seek a single target and destroy them. Unaided by magic, they rely on their keen insight and indomitable determination to hunt down the unfortunate souls in their sights. Many manhunters are bounty hunters, while others are mercenaries, bandits, or soldiers who excel at eliminating dangerous battlefield threats.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can take 10 minutes to gather and ruminate upon information about a creature. That creature becomes your mark, and you gain insight into that creature's thoughts, beliefs, and style of combat. You can also mark a creature when it misses a melee attack against you or when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack. You can have a number of marks equal to your Wisdom modifier at any one time (minimum of one). You can remove marks at the end of a short rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a target is marked, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks against your mark.</li>
                <li>If your mark misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against them.</li>
                <li>When you take an attack of opportunity against your mark, you can grapple them instead of making a weapon attack.</li>

            <p>At 7th level, you gain proficiency in Insight. If you are already proficient in it, you gain proficiency in Animal Handling, Intimidation, Perception, Survival, or Thieves' Tools instead. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Insight. You receive this benefit regardless of the skill proficiency you gain from this feature.</p>

            <p>Also at 7th level, you can spend 1d4 hours whenever you enter a city or other urban area to gather information about a mark. This includes entering taverns, interrogating their allies, or retracing their steps. Afterwards, roll 1d20 to determine the results of your research. You can only gather information about a single mark at a time.</p>

            <p>Starting at 15th level, your reading of your marks has become almost precognizant, allowing you to predict what they will do and react appropriately to protect others. When a mark makes a melee weapon attack against an allied creature, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward both creatures and shove that ally 5 feet away from your mark. You then become the target of your mark's attack. If that attack misses you, you can make one weapon attack as part of the same reaction you used to move.</p>

            <p>Starting at 18th level, your ability to recognize incoming attacks and counter them—to wade into a brawl and emerge unscathed—is unparalleled. The first melee weapon attack a mark makes against you each turn has disadvantage. You no longer require a reaction to attack when a mark misses you. You can only attack after a miss once on any creature's turn, even if a mark misses you more than once.</p>
