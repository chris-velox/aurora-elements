        <description>
            <p>All barbarians have powerful rage. Those who follow the Path of the Cataclysm have a more tangible rage than most. Theirs is a rage that bursts from them as untamed elemental fury, devastating and all-encompassing. Attuned to the the greatest extremes of natural disasters, Cataclysms train with druids or other barbarians in places where the reaches of civilization end and the truth of primal magic can be revealed. These bastions of elemental power represent the chaotic energy of the natural world at its mightiest, and wield it on the battlefield to widespread, devastating effect.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, the power of a certain environment or phenomenon explodes from you while you rage, creating a roiling aura of elemental energy that extends 10 feet from you in every direction, though not behind total cover. The aura’s radius increases to 15 feet at level 10 and 20 feet at level 14.</p>
            <p class="indent">Choose a catastrophe from the ones listed below. Your aura gains features based on the type you choose, and you can power the element to which you are attuned whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>
            <p class="indent">Regardless of type, all auras deal damage equal to half your barbarian level to all creatures of your choice within your aura at the start of your turn. The damage type is determined by the aura, and is considered magical damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you enter a rage, and as an action while raging, you can send a surge of power through your aura, dealing 1d8 + your Constitution modifier to all creatures of your choice within it. This explosion of power deals the same damage type as your aura.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your aura’s effects require a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. If you can target an object, space, or creature with an aura’s features, you can do so at any time during your turn, requiring no action.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Volcano.</b> You radiate incredible heat and powerful flames, dealing fire damage and casting bright light within and 15 feet beyond the limits of your aura, and dim light for another 15. Your attunement to magma or flame spreads it to the landscape around you, superheating the ground. When you deal aura damage at the start of your turn, all creatures within 5 feet of you take twice the damage instead, or thrice the damage if they are prone.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Flood.</b> You are a portal to the crushing weight of the ocean’s depths. Your aura deals bludgeoning damage. Creatures in your aura have their jump height halved. For all creatures of your choice, the space in your aura is difficult terrain.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Tempest.</b> Wind and lightning surge from your body, casting bright light within and 15 feet beyond the limits of your aura, and dim light for another 15. You deal lightning damage, and at the start of your turn you can deal doubled aura damage to a single creature of your choice. If that creature is composed of or wearing metal, you can move that creature up to 15 feet toward or away from you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Blizzard.</b> Winter winds and frigid snow surround you when you rage. You deal cold damage, and can use plunging temperature to sooth the flames of battle. Once per turn, you can give an allied creature of your choice a number of temporary hit points equal to your barbarian level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Blight.</b> You emanate miasma and disease. You deal necrotic damage, and all hostile creatures within your aura suffer disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks until they leave your aura as plague and parasites wrack their body.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Earthquake.</b> Your blows carry the incredible power of shifting earth and falling avalanches. You deal thunder damage, and once per turn you can focus the tremors on a hostile of creature of your choice. That creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Sandstorm.</b> Sand whirls around you, heavily obscuring creatures of your choice within your aura. You deal slashing damage, and can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a ranged attack made within or that enters your aura.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Corona.</b> You explode with the power of the sun. You deal radiant damage, and cast bright light in a 20-foot radius around yourself and dim light for another 20. Once per turn, you can intensify the glare for one creature, which must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of its next turn.</p>

            <p>At 14th level, you can use powerful magics that personify your disaster. You learn a pair of spells determined by your chosen aura, which you can cast only while raging, though if your rage ends while you are concentrating on a spell the spell continues.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can cast and concentrate upon these spells while raging, unlike normal spells. You also cast them without material components. You can cast each spell once per rage. You can cast either a second time, but if you do so your rage immediately ends. Your spellcasting stat for these spells is Constitution, and all are cast at 4th level if they are not a higher level.</p>
