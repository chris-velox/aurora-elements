            <p>A follower of the Hurricane moves faster than the eye can see, streaking from one target to the next in a dizzying blur. From a distance, their battles sound like a barrage of cannonfire, and they whip up torrential winds that send their enemies flying like leaves in a gale. The few who survive battles with its followers claim their opponent teleported behind them and punished their mistakes with a storm of brutal attacks.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you specialize in attacks that hurl your body across across the battlefield in the blink of an eye. Whenever you take the Dash or Disengage action, you can make an unarmed strike.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the attack hits, a shockwave of power explodes from the point of impact. Every creature within 5 feet of the target other than you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is knocked 10 feet away from the target. Large or smaller objects not being worn or carried are hurled the same distance.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature collides with another creature or an object, it takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.</p>

        <description>
            <p>The Way of the Hurricane teaches aggression and rewards decisive action. Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacker. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the attacker, you can also make one melee weapon attack against it.</p>

            <p>Also at 11th level, your impatient nature, nurtured by your training, allows you to scream across the battlefield. In combat, you have a special reaction that you can take once on every creature’s turn, except your turn. You can only use this special reaction if you spend 2 ki to activate it, and you can’t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction. You can use this special reaction only to use Rushdown or Slow Fall.</p>

            <p>Starting at 17th level, you move faster than the eye can see, and your attacks break the sound barrier. When you move, you can spend any amount of movement to teleport that distance instead of moving normally, so long as you move into an unoccupied space that you can see.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you teleport, you unleash a booming thunderclap that all creatures within 300 feet of you can hear.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you teleport within 5 feet of a creature and hit it with an attack, you can spend 1 ki point to deal additional thunder damage equal to half your monk level.</p>
