        <description>
            <p>Bulwarks of grit and implacable scions of self-sacrifice, Bastions are master guardians. They pride themselves on the simple (but fundamental) dwarven martial art of collective defense. To dwarves, clan and honor eclipse the self, so others’ defence is fundamental to their military training. But anyone can use these skills.</p>

            <p>When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action while you are wielding a shield to adopt a stance that braces you and yours against attacks. You can enter or leave Defensive Stance as a bonus action on your turn. It lasts for 1 minute or until you choose to end it, and it confers the following benefits while active.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Towering Shield.</b> You can take the Dodge action as a bonus action, have advantage on Strength checks, and can use your reaction to become the target of an attack made against any creature within your reach so long as the attacker can reach you as well. Creatures of your choice have half cover when within 5 feet of you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Center of Attention.</b> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon atttack it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn. You can only affect one creature at a time with this feature.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Mad Taunt.</b> At any time during the turn of a creature within your reach, you can taunt or otherwise draw the creature’s attention. The next attack the creature makes against you is made with advantage, and the next attack made against it before the end of your next turn has advantage. You can only taunt one creature at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent">You cannot move more than half your speed in Defensive stance. You can enter a Defensive Stance a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of 1), and regain all uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>Starting at 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you and other nearby creatures while in a Defensive Stance. If you or a creature you can see within your reach is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. You add the result of the die to the target’s AC against that attack. You can use this reaction once per Defensive Stance.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 15th level, if the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage.</p>
