            <p class="indent">You are not a paltry singer or teller of tawdry tales. Your voice is your instrument, ancient words your performance. Those born with the power to join the College of the Voice carry the uncanny power to make their words reality by screaming nature into submission. Through bellowed incantations, you change the world around you to suit your whims.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, the power of your voice adds new spells to your arsenal and alters your existing ones. You can learn the spells on the shouts table when you reach the appropriate level in this class, and if they are not bard spells already they are considered bard spells for you. They do not require material or somatic components. If they do not have a verbal component, one is added, and the sound of your voice when you cast these spells booms outward. All creatures within 300 feet hear you when you cast a spell on the shout table. In addition to spell slots, you can expend a bardic inspiration die to attempt to cast one of these spells. Roll the die. If the number is at least the number of the spell slot of the spell you are attempting to cast, you cast it. Whether or not you successfully cast the spell, the inspiration die is expended. You cannot use this feature to cast spells of a higher level than you have slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">Spells marked with a * on the table are already on the bard spell list.</p>

            <p>At 6th level you can project your voice as a weapon. As an action, you expend a 1st-level spell slot and force each creature in a 30-foot cone to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Creatures that fail take 2d8 thunder damage, are shoved 10 feet away from you, and fall prone. On a success they take half damage and are not moved or knocked prone. For every spell slot higher than 1st, the damage increases by 1d8 and the distance by 10 feet.</p>
