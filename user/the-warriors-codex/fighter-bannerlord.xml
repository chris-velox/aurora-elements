            <p>Skilled in combat both mounted and on foot, Bannermen are the noble, powerful leaders of the battlefield. Also called bannerets, chevaliers, and men-at-arms, these soldiers direct the flow of battle and bolster their allies with their very presence. Leaders by example, they are some of the first to enter the field and one of the last to leave it.</p>

You, and each friendly creature within 15 feet of you gains one of the following benefits, which you choose when you activate this feature:</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>But it is not this day.</b> Each affected creature gains temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Draw swords together.</b> Each affected creature can use its reaction to become the target of an attack against another creature within 5 feet of it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Do not go gentle.</b> Each affected creature can add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to its death saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Fear Not, I am Here.</b> Each affected creature has advantage on saving throws against fear.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b>Hold the line.</b> Each affected creature can add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to its Strength checks.</p>

            <p class="indent">While Raise the Colors is active, you can restore an ally’s fighting spirit by expending one hit die as a bonus action. A friendly creature of your choice within reach of Raise the Colors gains the hit points from that hit die, instead of you.</p>
