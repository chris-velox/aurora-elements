        <description>
            <p>Also known as Dragon Knights or Dragonslayers, Dragoons emulate the grace and power of dragons whenever possible. To a Dragoon, combat is an acrobatic affair, mastering powerful leaps and aerial strikes to shatter their foes’ defenses using weapons charged with the elemental power of dragons.</p>

            <h5 class="flavor">JUMPING RULES</h5>
            <p class="flavor">Long jumps can cover a lateral distance equal to the character’s Strength score with a 10ft running start, or half as much without a running start. High jumps can reach a height of 3 + the character’s Strength score with a 10ft running start, or half as much without a running start. All distance covered while jumping expends movement normally.</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">A character with 16 STR can cover 16 feet with a running long jump, and can jump 6 feet in the air with a running high jump. This running long jump consumes 26 of the typical 30 feet of movement.</p>
            <p class="flavor indent">To contrast, a Dragoon with 16 STR can use their action to jump 30 feet laterally and 27 feet vertically, and make a single attack. While their doubled lateral distance would reaches 32 feet, they can’t jump more than 30 feet until their level 7 feature allowed them to exceed it.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level, you can use your action to make an empowered leap, which reaches twice the length and thrice the height of your standard running jumps, without making a running start. You reduce any falling damage you take, ignoring 1d6 per fighter level. Additionally, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity while jumping. Once during the jump, if a creature comes within your reach, you can make a melee weapon attack against it. Any falling damage you avoided is transferred to the target of Skystrike as the damage type you chose in Draconic Attunement. The attack granted by Skystrike has advantage against creatures with a flying speed or are currently airborne. You can use this attack 3 times per short rest, though you do not expend a use if the attack misses.</p>
            <p class="indent">Starting at 5th level, the attack granted by Skystrike deals 1d6 additional damage of the type chosen in Draconic Attunement. This increases to 2d6 at 7th level, 3d6 at 10th level, 4d6 at 15th level, and 5d6 at 18th level in fighter.</p>
