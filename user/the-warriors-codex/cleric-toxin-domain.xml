            <p>You have entered the service of one of the gods of poisoning, venom, and intoxication. These gods, which include Lolth, Dionysus, Talona, Achlys, and Zehir, value a variety of ideals, but all share a love of substances that twist the senses and damage the body. The burning pains of acidic venom, the dulled joy of drunkenness, and the potent sting of a snakebite all fall under this domain, as does the gleam of fluid on an assassins’ knife or the bubbling of a hag’s brew.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Your divinely inspired knowledge of intoxicants allows you to craft familiar concoctions with holy magic. Starting at 1st level, you ignore the specific material components required to craft toxins such as Wyvern Venom and Purple Worm poison; instead your god empowers you to enchant mundane materials with the same effects. Your prayers also enhance the potency of your poisons—you can use your Cleric spell save DC instead of the listed DC for poisons that you have crafted. You are also magically inured to the effects of poison; you have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage.</p>

For the next minute or until you are incapacitated, the target of successful melee attacks you make with that weapon must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be poisoned for the next minute. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poison on itself and becoming immune to Fangs of Steel for the next 24 hours on a success.</p>

            <p>At 17th level, your deity’s power has imbued you with toxicity to such a degree that you actually benefit from harmful chemicals. Drinking a poison or taking poison damage restores hit points equal to the amount of damage you would take in one turn of suffering the poison. If a poison deals damage over multiple turns, you only restore that HP once, because you cannot be poisoned and therefore suffer no effects over time.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, you can drink a dose of Purple Worm Poison and and heal 12d6 damage.</p>
