            <p>Brawlers, battleragers, gladiators, ravagers, and pugilists, Bonebreakers wield crude-but-powerful weapons older than any other: their own two fists. Seemingly impervious to pain, their bone-shattering blows can dent the finest armor and sunder the hardest scales. To a Bonebreaker, magic and weapon alike can never compete with a strong right hook.</p>

            <p>You are proficient in spiked armor. Spiked armor is light armor that weighs 20 lbs. While you wear it, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. It is primarily made from plates of boiled leather with sharp metal embedded in the surface. When worn by a bonebreaker, it deals 1d4 piercing damage to any creature that the wearer grapples, or grapples the wearer, at the start of each of the grappler’s turns. When worn by any other character, it is considered leather armor.</p>
            <p class="indent">You also gain proficiency in Leatherworker’s Tools, and can use them to reassemble any leather or hide armor into a set of spiked armor and two cestuses during a short rest.</p>

            <p>Your unarmed strikes hit harder than any others, striking vital areas and crushing armor. At 3rd level you gain proficiency in unarmed strikes and improvised weapons. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and your attacks with a cestus (detailed in part 2) deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage. When you make a weapon attack while holding no weapons or wielding a cestus in both hands, you can make an additional melee weapon attack when you take the attack action.</p>
