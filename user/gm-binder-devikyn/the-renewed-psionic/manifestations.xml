            <p class="indent">You create a psychokinetic shield around one creature or object within range that you can see. The shield protects its manifestations and magic from outside influence. The DC for <em>dispel magic</em> or <em>negate psionics</em> is increased by 7 against that target. This includes attempts to negate <em>ablating</em>.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> If invoked at 8th level, this manifestation&#8217;s duration is concentration, up to 8 hours. If invoked at 9th level, it is 24 hours, without requiring concentration, and if <em>ablating</em> is used at this level on the same target for 30 consecutive days, its effects last until negated.</p>

You can only have one gem in existence affected by this manifestation at any given time. The appearance of the gem does not change after invoking this manifestation.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you die, your physical body crumbles to dust, leaving all of your equipment, and your soul transfers into the storage gem as long as it is on the same plane of existence. The gem begins to glow, and any attempt to bring your soul back to life fails while you inhabit it. Once this effect occurs, you can hear and see as if you were in the gem&#8217;s space, but you cannot move or interact in any way that the gem couldn&#8217;t. You may remain in this form for up to 30 days, after which your soul disengages from the gem and passes on.</p>

Your original body&#8217;s constituent parts are pulled as ectoplasm through the astral plane, then slowly molded and transformed into a living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body at the time you manifested <em>astral regeneration</em>. If the developing body takes any kind of damage while forming, it becomes ruined and uninhabitable. When the tenth day ends, the crystal crumbles and merges with your new body, and you completely and totally inhabit it.</p>

While not being ridden, the wolf remains in place and takes no actions, and any attempts to interact with it pass through it harmlessly. The creature uses the statistics for a Winter Wolf, except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the manifestation ends, the wolf gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the wolf is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Display: The object has a subtle brand for the duration</p>
            <p class="indent">Choose one nonmagical object of size Medium or smaller within range that is not being worn or carried. The object telekinetically "comes to life", moving and acting under your control until the manifestation ends or until it is destroyed.</p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can mentally command the object controlled with this manifestation if it is within 500 feet of you. You decide what action the object will take and where it will move during its next turn. A command must be direct, such as "attack that target", "open that door" or "lift that object" in order for the object to be able to follow it. You can also command an object to carry out a task that it is suited for, such as telling a controlled lock to unlock itself. If you do, it cannot directly complete the task, but creatures have advantage on ability checks to fulfill the task on the object. If you issue no commands, the object only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

            <p class="indent">A controlled object remains an object, but it has AC and damage based on its size. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. Its speed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0.</p>
            <p class="indent">If ordered to attack, the object can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack, using your psionic attack modifier as its attack bonus. Its attacks deal bludgeoning damage determined by its size, adding your Intelligence modifier to the roll. The DM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.</p>

            <p class="indent">You psychokinetically control the actions of one humanoid within range that you can see. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you can choose the target&#8217;s external physical actions during each of its turns, such as standing up, sitting down, walking, turning around, lifting objects, attacking with a weapon, and so on. You can also restrain it until the start of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Physical actions which require internal muscular control, such as speaking, are impossible with this manifestation. You cannot force the target to use any mental abilities, such as invoking a manifestation, casting a spell, or using any special ability that is not a function of just its body movements. However, if the creature can perform these actions without muscular control of its body, it can still do so of its own accord.</p>
            <p class="indent">An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending this manifestation on a success. Additionally, if you cannot see the target at any time, this manifestation ends.</p>

            <p class="indent">You and another willing, corporeal, living creature of no more than one size larger or smaller than you fuse into one being. As the manifester, you control the actions of the fused being. However, you can give up this control to the other creature. Once you give up control, you cannot regain it unless the other creature relinquishes it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The fused being has your hit points plus the other creature&#8217;s hit points. The fused being knows all of the manifestations, has the same amount of psionic power, knows or has prepared the same spells, and has the same amount of spell slots as both creatures combined. Any spent psionic power or spell slots prior to the fusion are retained on the fused being. Likewise, all feats, racial abilities, and class features are pooled (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being gains it only once.) For each of the six ability scores, the fused being&#8217;s score is the higher of yours and the other creature&#8217;s, its Hit Dice are those of both creatures combined, and the fused being has the higher level of the two creatures. The fused being gains all proficiencies and expertise of both beings.</p>
            <p class="indent">You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being and what equipment remains available for use. These fused items are restored to their original owners once the manifestation ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the manifestation ends, the fused being separates, both creatures appearing in the nearest unoccupied space. If separation occurs in a space without room for both creatures, both creatures are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, take 12d6 force damage and are stunned for 1 minute.</p>
            <p class="indent">Damage taken by the fused being is discarded when the manifestation ends. Each constituent creature of the fusion is returned with exactly the same amount of hit points it had before it entered the fusion. However, any resources spent by the fused being are transferred to the original creatures when <em>fusion</em> ends. Any debilitating effects are split between you and the other creature. If any effects cannot be evenly split, you determine who receives the additional loss.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent creatures, both of which are also dead. You cannot use <em>fusion</em> on a being already fused by this manifestation.</p>

You can see and target creatures and objects as if you were in the prism&#8217;s space, and while the prism is within 5 feet of you, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.

If the prism drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn. The manifestation then ends.</p>

However, you can emulate its senses freely as if you were in its body, but only from its point of view. This allows you to make ability checks while benefitting from a creature&#8217;s unique features, among other things. For example, you can smell through the nose of a wolf that is hiding in a bush, and you would smell the bush as well as yourself, as the wolf would. You can also see through the eyes of a hawk in flight, allowing you to get a bird&#8217;s eye view with its exceptional vision.</p>

            <p class="flavor">Display: Your hair turns white while invoking</p>
            <p class="indent">A <em>psychic divination</em> can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, suppose the question is "What are our chances of storming the front gate of the Dreaming Tower?" The DM knows that the front gate is guarded by eight <em>giant spiders</em> waiting to ambush gatecrashers, but estimates that your party could win past after a hard fight. Therefore, the <em>psychic divination</em> response might be: "Terrible danger is conquered by resolute strength of arms and an equal measure of cunning strategy." In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. Note that if your party doesn&#8217;t act on the information, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful.</p>
            <p class="indent">The DM rolls a d10 in secret; on a result of 4 or above, you receive a correct divination. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, precautions against Clairsentience have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the manifestation failed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Multiple <em>psychic divinations</em> about the same action by the same manifester use the same dice roll result as the first <em>psychic divination</em> and yield the same answer each time.</p>

            <p class="indent">A <em>psychic precognition</em> can provide you with a useful vision in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 year. The advice can be as simple as a short glimpse of a meaningful image, or it might take the form of a full-length dream lasting several minutes.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, suppose the question is "What is the greatest danger our party will face in the coming year?" The DM eventually wants to pit the party against a black dragon he has long prepared, and he consideres this the worst threat that "fate" has in store for the party. Therefore, the <em>psychic precognition</em> response might be this vision: "You see you and your comrades standing before the mouth of a high, dark cave. The entrance is blocked by a steaming pool of acid, while the rock all around is scorched by acid and lacerated by what can only be gargantuan claws." In all cases, the DM controls what information you receive. Note that if your party doesn&#8217;t act on the information, the conditions probably change so that the information is no longer useful.</p>
            <p class="indent">The DM rolls a d10 in secret; on a result of 3 or above, you receive a correct divination. The DM adjusts the chance if unusual circumstances require it (if, for example, precautions against Clairsentience have been taken). If the dice roll fails, you know the manifestation failed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Multiple <em>psychic precognitions</em> about the same action by the same manifester use the same dice roll result as the first <em>psychic precognition</em> and yield the same answer each time.</p>

            <p class="indent">You collapse a bit of time from the continuum, forming a dollop of thick, gooey material called quintessence that weighs 0.1 lb. The substance shimmers like a silver mirror. Psionic creatures can handle quintessence by shielding itself with a small amount of psionic energy when touching it. However, they must do so with care, as quintessence inhibits psionics. A psionic creature within 5 feet of at least 1 lb of quintessence cannot use its psionic abilities, and it can only properly handle the quintessence if it succeeds on an Intelligence check of DC 10 plus 1 per lb of quintessence.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use your action to smooth a dollop of quintessence around any extremely small object, such as a key, a ring, a seal, or an insignia. Objects sealed with quintessence are protected from the effects of time, entering a state of stasis. Large quantities of quintessence can be gathered to preserve large items or structures, or even a complete living creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can also use your action to apply a dollop of quintessence to a small amount of a creature&#8217;s living flesh, partially pulling it out of the time stream. Make a ranged psionic attack against one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target is affected by quintessence, which forces it to take 1d4 force damage at the end of each of its turns for 1 minute, at which point the quintessence is too disrupted to be effective.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each dollop of quintessence can be used only once. Quintessence can be manually scraped away from a protected object, freeing it to rejoin the time stream. When you do this, the quintessence is not recovered.</p>
