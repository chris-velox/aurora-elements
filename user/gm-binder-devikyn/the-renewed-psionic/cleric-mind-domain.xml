            <p>Clerics of the mind domain channel the powers of the divine through psionic power, granted to them by their faith. These practitioners can call upon the magic of the divine, as well as project the authority of their faith’s domain using their mind, rather than channeling their power into manifestations. Deities such as Auppenser, Deneir and even those like Ilsensine and Sseth call upon clerics of this domain.</p>

            <p>Also at 1st level, the psionic energy channeling through you manifests as an aura, which bolsters you and your allies’ abilities. This aura projects outward in a 10-foot radius around you, ignoring cover, and moves with you. The aura is disabled while you are unconscious. You and creatures of your choice within the aura can add your Wisdom modifier to their initiative rolls.</p>
            <p class="indent">Also, when a creature within the aura other than you makes a Wisdom (Perception) check, you can use your reaction to grant a +4 bonus to the check. You can do so before or after rolling the d20, but before the GM determines the outcome of the check. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and expended uses are replenished when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 17th level, the radius of this aura increases to 30 feet and creatures of your choice within the aura can add a +2 bonus to their attack and damage rolls, as well as to their AC.</p>

                <li>Your weapon attacks become magical and deal psychic damage instead of their normal damage type.</li>
                <li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 5 + two per each of your cleric levels, which last until this effect ends.</li>
