            <p>For a renegade few, battle sounds different than it does for the typical rogue. The clash of steel and the sizzle of spell energy are drowned out by the thunderous rhythm of gunfire, the pounding beat of the gunslinger.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you use charismatic flair to accomplish near impossible feats with firearms. You learn two Trick Shots of your choice as listed below. Many Trick Shots enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one Trick Shot per attack. You learn one additional Trick Shot at 9th, 13th and 17th level. Each time you gain a level in this class you can replace one Trick Shot you know with a different one. The amount of Trick Shots you can make is equal to your Charisma modifier and you regain expended uses after finishing a short or long rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 17th level, you've learned to focus all your fire into one devastating attack. You ignore the reload property for all firearms. Also on your turn, if you take the Attack action with a firearm, you can choose to Fan the Hammer. The amount of attacks you can make when you Fan the Hammer is equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum two attacks). Make one attack roll, all subsequent attacks take a -2 penalty, and any critical or Sneak Attack damage dealt only applies to the first hit, as well as any Trick Shots you make. For example, with a Dexterity score of 16 you can make three attacks. If you have an attack roll of 22 (+ 3 Dexterity modifier + 6 proficiency bonus and a roll of 13 on the d20), the attacks have a 22, 20, and 18 to hit respectively. You can choose to Fan the Hammer after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You regain the use of this feature when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
