        <description>There are those rogues out there sought after not for their stealth, but for their keen eyes and brilliant minds. These individuals are often hired to track the untraceable, see the unseeable and build cases for or against the government. Investigators are often neutral parties, not putting emotions over the facts they see around them, they simply want to know the truth and what truly happened in any circumstance.</description>

            <p>Also, at 3rd level, you build connections better than others because you're able to put the pieces of the puzzle together to find out who may have been involved. If you spend one hour talking to individuals in a populated area, or 24 hours talking to people in a populated area, you are able to find a witness to the event in which you seek answers for. The GM decides if this witness is credible or not, but you can use other skills to see if they can in fact be trusted.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition, whenever you successfully find information at a scene you are researching, you can gain information about the creature who may have been involved. Every hour you spend at the scene gains you one of the following clues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The creature’s approximate size</li>
                <li>The creature’s sex</li>
                <li>The creature’s race</li>
            </ul>
