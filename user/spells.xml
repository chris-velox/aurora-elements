        <description>
            <p>A vertical column of spiders begins to rain down in a location you specify. Each creature that starts its turn within the 20-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A Swarm of Spiders (<i>Monster Manual</i>, pg 334) descends onto each creature within the cylinder. On a failed saving throw, this swarm has full hit points (22). On a successful save, this swarm has half hit points (11).</p>
            <p class="indent">This swarm is considered to be climbing on the target creature and moves with them, even if they leave the affected area, and takes its turn immediately after that creature’s turn. A creature can make use of its action to attempt to get them off, making a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the spell save DC of the caster.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a creature is already swarmed by spiders starts their turn in the area of effect, they repeat the saving throw. The swarm on that creature gains 22 current and maximum hit points on a failed save, and 11 current and maximum hitpoints on a success save. The swarm’s hit points cannot go above 22 for a medium creature, 44 for a large or larger creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any spiders that remain when the spell ends disappear after 1d4 rounds.</p>

            <p>Touch a pile of at least 10 corpses of Rats that died within the last week. Your spell imbues the targets with a foul mimicry of life, raising them as an undead swarm. The targets become a swarm of zombie rats. The swarm uses the statistics of a Swarm of Rats, but has half as many hitpoints, as well as immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. If the pile of corpses has at least 20 rats in it, the swarm comes to life with its regular amount of hitpoints.</p>

        <supports>Druid, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You warp and shape the landscape and climate of an area up to 1 mile square, transforming it into the type of terrain you desire. As part of casting the spell, you choose a type of terrain such as arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp, along with any number of specific features such as rivers, hills, certain plants and animals, or specific variations of the terrain. You can lay out what you’d like the region to be like in detail, but you lack precise control over the exact layout of the resulting geography. You can also select any number of structures or locations within the area to exclude, sparing them from the destructive process that this spell entails. The changes occur over the course of 1 hour after casting the spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">During the terraforming, the land is ravaged by the magical forces you have wrought. The geography is physically torn asunder, splitting into ravines, rising into mountains, being reshaped into the type of terrain that you specified. Forests can wither and disintegrate into deserts, or mountains can turn from rock to ice, forming mighty glaciers.</p>
            <p class="indent">The climate is modified to allow for your desired terrain, regardless of the previous or surrounding climatology. These changes are provided with physical means of occurring within the terrain, for example, to warm the region, hot geysers or lava flows may form, or to cool the region, streams of ice may flow through the area. Wind and clouds spontaneously form or are dispersed within the region in order to match the required climate.</p>
            <p class="indent">Plants within the region are formed, and rapidly grow to a mixture of stages of life, as if the region had been this way for centuries. Any existing plants in the area are destroyed and their biomatter re-used to create the new plants. Any existing creatures in the area will most likely be killed by tectonic upheaval if they remain, taking 5d12 bludgeoning damage for every minute they spend in the region, and animals within the area instinctually flee en-masse once the spell is cast. This spell does not create new animal life in the region, but animals within 10 miles that can thrive in the terrain are drawn to it, causing it to become rapidly populated with the appropiate types and amounts of creatures within 7 days, if they’re available.</p>
            <p class="indent">Any structures within the region that you did not exclude from the spell are sundered by titanic forces, suffering 50 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns for the 1 hour duration of the terraforming. If a structure drops to 0 hitpoints, it collapses and is disintegrated into dust, which is re-used in the terraforming process. If a non-excluded structure somehow survives the process, it is merely incorporated into the terrain, such as being overgrown with native plants or becoming half-buried in sand, instead of being destroyed. Any structure that you excluded from the spell is spared the destruction, though any plants or creatures within may find the new terrain inhospitable.</p>
            <p class="indent">The climate of the region is magically enforced, but once the process is complete, the region behaves as natural terrain, and can be disrupted by events such as fires, animal migrations, earthquakes, or other physical phenomena, natural or artificial. If you cast this spell on a plane or world other than your native one, you can only specify terrain types and features that occur on your native plane or world. The region still obeys the physics of whatever plane it exists in, so attempting to break the physics of a plane, such as creating floating islands on the material, or forming a glacier in the plane of fire, will end poorly, such as the glacier melting, or the floating islands crashing to the ground.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell can be disrupted by <em>dispel magic</em> during the 1 hour terraforming process, but once that time has elapsed, only another <em>terraform</em> spell or the power of the <em>wish</em> spell can return the region to its original state.</p>

            <p>You summon the Chariot of Sustarre from the elemental plane of fire, appearing with a clap of thunder amid a cloud of roiling smoke and fire in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. The chariot is a Huge vehicle decorated with a sunburst motif and drawn by two elemental horses of flame.</p>
            <p class="indent">For the duration, the chariot follows your verbal commands on your turn. The flaming steeds take no actions, but move as you direct them, pulling the chariot with a speed of 60 feet and a fly speed of 120 feet. The chariot and its steeds are immune to all damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The chariot emanates an aura of fire within 10 feet of it. When you cast this spell, you can designate up to 7 other creatures you can see to be undamaged by the chariot. When any other creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the spell ends, the chariot and its steeds return to the plane of fire, leaving its passengers and anything else inside behind. A <em>divine word</em> or a <em>banishment</em> spell that affects both steeds ends the spell.</p>

            <p>Sharpened stalks of bamboo burst from the ground in a 15-foot square within range. Each creature in the area when the bamboo appears must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 3d6 piercing damage and is restrained until the end of your next turn, or it uses an action to escape.</p>
            <p class="indent">The bamboo remains after the spell is cast, turning the area into difficult terrain.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You create five sandstone tablets carved with hieroglyphs in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell’s duration. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to expend one of the tablets, causing the attack to instead miss you and destroy the tablet.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you cast the spell — and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter — you can expend one of the tablets, launching it at a target of your choice within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d12 bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">When all the tablets are expended, the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of tablets created increases by one for each slot level above 7th.</p>

            <p>Two creatures of your choice within range that can see eachother must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed by the other target of the spell, becoming obsessed with staying by their side. A charmed creature can’t willingly move away from the other creature, and must use its movement on its turns to move towards the target of their infatuation, getting as close as is possible without harming itself. If grappled, restrained, or otherwise prevented from moving, the charmed creature has advantage on ability checks and saving throws to escape.</p>

            <p>This spell places a magical mark on a willing creature, so that they may be found if lost. For the duration, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find the marked creature.

            <p class="indent">If the marked creature is reduced to 0 hitpoints, you immediately receive a mental alarm and feeling of danger. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.</p>
            <p class="indent"><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> The spell’s duration increases when you cast it using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher: 8 Hours with a 2nd level slot, 24 hours with a 3rd level slot, 7 days with a 4th level slot, 30 days with a 5th level slot, 1 year with a 6th level slot. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled.</p>
