            <p class="flavor">"Generally, your kind can barely grunt a single syllable, but you? Your brain matches your brawn, perhaps exceeds it."</p>
            <p>One who is seen as an outsider to society, a person of great rage and passion. Barbarians may seem like the stereotypical near-nude warriors, cut from the cloth of pure muscle and a brute presence.</p>
            <p class="indent">Thankfully, not all barbarians are created equal, there are those that practice worship to the undead deities, called to forever fight in tremendous wars after death, or those that are nomadic and gathering food for their family.</p>
            <p class="indent">No matter the path they walk, barbarians become overwhelmed with intense emotions during the heat of battle. Whether this is the passion of battle, the fury of spilt blood, or the love of hunt as sport, the result is the same - their endurance cannot be overcome, forging a supernatural strength that is not normally seen. This boost is temporary, and often described as a rage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Another fun fact! I once had an acquaintance that was obsessed with having a "great death" before they reached old age. But the hilarious part about it is that no matter what, no one was powerful enough to defeat him! He would go into a rage, looking for a death that he could not obtain!</p>

                <p class="indent">Barbarians have a terrifying fury that hides deep within them. The anger that they harness can turn the tides in a battle, but can also be a hinderance. While all barbarian's rage is different from one another, there are some things that may just push them over the edge.</p>
                <p class="indent">Tapping into their rage enhances their ability, furthering their strength. An event that occurs may automatically trigger their rage without meaning to.</p>

            <p>There is more to a bard than just reciting poetry and strumming their lute. In fact, bards seem to unravel the hidden mysteries of lore and history with every lyric, bringing the tale to life.</p>

Knowledge, they realize, is often dark, dreadful, and lacking the audience's emotional attachment.

                <p class="indent">Wizards study various spells in order to get an understanding of the basic concepts. They will spend hours doing so, pouring over ancient tomes, scribbling notes. Each wizard makes the spells they know their own, in some sort of fashion. How do you perform the spells?</p>
