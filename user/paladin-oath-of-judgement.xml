    <description>
      <p>There are but precious few paladins who cannot bear to stand to see injustice go unpunished and evils left running rampant. Most paladins dedicate themselves to the righteousness of good or the preservation of beauty, light, and peace. Others bring themselves to the edge of good and evil by seeking dominion over the fouler forces through sheer power while few still act on furious vengeance. Fewer are those who would remove themselves from the equation of good and evil entirely, acting as executioners and hunters to serve balance in the universe. Those who follow the Oath of Judgement are akin to judges and enforcers of law of the highest order. They work to make sure no crime goes unpunished and that none escape judgement where justice and balance is due, traveling to realms where chaos reigns supreme and law is all but unknown. These paladins bring order to those realms, meteing out crime with a stern hand through their spells to track and incapacitate.</p>

      <p>Few things are exact between any who follow the Oath of judgement, but there are some core ideals that all of them follow.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Detachment.</i></b> Do not let your emotions sway the sword of judgement.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Fairness.</i></b> All are to be treated with fairness and neutrality, no matter their race, sex, wealth, or power.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Balance.</i></b> Punishment and mercy are to be dealt with an even hand, acting in accordance to the situation. Never favor one over other.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Wisdom.</i></b> Temper the fire of your steel with experience. Never strike if uncertain.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>Patience.</i></b> Judgement is unfailing, unwavering, and unassailable. Judgement will prevail in time.</p>
