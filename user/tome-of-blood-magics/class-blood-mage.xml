        <description>
            <p>A hooded half-elf overlooking a pallasade puts a knife through his hand and whispers an incantation. He watches as six droplets of blood fly from his outstretched palm into the backs of the guards stationed on the wall, who then silently succumb to sleep.</p>
            <p class="indent">Grabbing a snow white bunny in one hand, a dying halfling mutters some few words of power, stealing life from his pet, and feeling it surge through his body as he rises to his feet.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human hiding behind a stalagmite brings his blood-red axe down on a surprised spider, feeling its lifeforce drain and granting him a momentary surge of vigor.</p>
            <p class="indent">Blood mages, through careful and dangerous studies, imbue the source of their life with arcane magic. By doing this they are able to empower their spells to help their allies or decimate their foes.</p>
            <h4>AN ANCIENT ART</h4>
            <p>A blood mage often being their journey in the library or in the field. Perhaps they learned their magic from the ruins of an ancient civilization that practiced the craft.</p>
            <p class="indent">The descent into the profane art beings with enhancement of their own life-essence, making them preternaturally fit. Their newly imbued arcane flesh allows them to study the sanguine substance without quite as much risk.</p>
            <h4>SACRIFICE AND GROWTH</h4>
            <p>Loss is second nature to blood mages. Study for this school of the arcane often involves rigorous testing usually on small animals, though some turn to larger prey, before finally turning the experiments upon their own flesh.</p>
            <p class="indent">Blood represents more than just death to these mages; it’s loss, sacrifice, purity, life, growth, and even the ability to cleanse. Through sacrificing their own body, these mages learn what it means to taste true power.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A BLOOD MAGE</h4>
            <p>When creating a blood mage, think of a reason as to why you  feel the need to delve into the study of magic and blood.  Perhaps it is due to the loss of a loved one. Maybe a friend  suffers from a genetic illness. Or you might be from a rich  and powerful bloodline, seeking to prove its strength.</p>

        <description>
            <p>You have learned to alter the fabric of reality through study of an ancient form of magic. Through careful study, you infuse your blood with arcane energy, allowing you to tap a vast resevoir of magic at will. See chapter 10 of the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for the general rules of spellcasting.</p>
            <h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
            <p>You know three cantrips of your choice from the blood mage spell list. You learn additional blood mage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Blood Mage table.</p>
            <h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
            <p>The Blood Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your blood mage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell command and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast command using either slot.</p>
            <h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
            <p>You know five 1st-level spells of your choice from the blood mage spell list.</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Blood Mage table shows when you learn more blood mage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the blood mage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the blood mage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your blood mage spells. Your magic comes from your knowledge and study of the inherent magic in your blood. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a blood mage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
            <p>You can cast any blood mage spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
            <h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
            <p>As a blood mage, you can use a bladed weapon as a spellcasting focus.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning at the 1st level, after careful study, you have infused your blood with magic, granting you enhanced vitality and the ability to draw upon great wells of arcane energy, at the cost of your life essence.</p>
            <h5>ARCANE FLESH</h5>
            <p>The magic coursing through your veins has granted you supernal hardiness. Your hit points are equal to 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier + half your Intelligence modifier rounded up per blood mage level and you gain an additional hit die per blood mage level.</p>
            <h5>BLOOD DICE</h5>
            <p>Every turn, you have a number of "blood dice", which are d4s. The maximum number of blood dice you can roll in a turn is determined by your blood mage level, as shown in the Blood Dice column of the Blood Mage table. These blood dice are used in certain class features and are also be used to cast spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">Whenever you roll a blood die, you take necrotic damage equal to the roll. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented, except by your Sanguine Relief ability, nor mitigated by temporary hit points. This damage also doesn’t force you to make Concentration checks.</p>
            <p class="indent">You cannot roll blood dice, and therefore cannot cast spells, if you are wearing any armor that is not a shield.</p>
            <h5>CASTING AND EMPOWERING SPELLS</h5>
            <p>Your blood is bursting at the seams with magic itching to escape. Whenever you cast a blood mage spell of 5th-level or lower, you must roll a minimum number of blood dice equal to the level of the expended slot, though you may choose to roll extra, you must choose to do so as the spell is cast. You are not required to roll blood dice to cast spells of 6th-level or higher, but may still choose to do so.</p>
            <p class="indent">If that spells deals damage or provides healing, you add the amount rolled to the healing given or necrotic damage dealt to a single creature affected by the spell, other than yourself.</p>
            <p class="indent">Should the spell affect two or more creatures, you may choose to double the damage you took from your blood dice to have the extra damage or healing affect all of those creatures, other than you.</p>
            <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 9th-level blood mage, and want to cast a burning hands spell at 5th-level, you must expend all five of your blood dice to do so, which damage you and empower your spell. If you, for whatever reason, do not have all five of your blood dice, you cannot cast that spell.</p>

Your creation automatically returns to your bloodstream if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or if you dismiss the creation as a bonus action. You can use your action to consume the creation, destroying it until you perform the ritual again. When you do, you regain your lost max hit points, but are not healed. This effect also occurs if you fail a death saving throw or die.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A blood mage raised in a smaller society, discovering their magic alone, may turn to a more traditional path: The Shaman. Shaman typically fill the role of a cunning folk or a medicine man in remote villages around the world. Using their blood magics as a means of warding off evil spirits, fighting that which lurks in the night, curing ailments and healing wounds, and blessing the village with bountiful harvests are all within the purview of a Shaman. </p>
            <p class="indent">When you choose this study at 2nd level, you learn the following spells, which are accounted for on the Spells Known column of the Blood Mage table. These spells are not on the blood mage spell list but they are nonetheless a blood mage spell for you:</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Spell Level</td><td>Spell Name</td></tr>
                </thead>
                <tr><td>1</td><td><i>Bless, Hex</i></td></tr>
            </table>
            <p class="indent">In addition, you gain the ability to create a voodou doll. Creating one takes a 10 minute ritual and 10gp worth of fabric and string. To link a voodou doll to a creature, you may use your bonus action to make a melee spell attack against one creature within range. On hit, roll any number of blood dice, and the creature takes that much damage. It is now linked to your voodou doll for as long as you remain concentrating on it, as though on a spell, up to a maximum of 1 hour.</p>

            <description>
                <p>Beginning at 6th level, you gain the ability to create shrunken heads, imbued with your magic. The creation of a head requires a 1 hour ritual, 20gp worth of special salts and string, and a creature’s head. You can have up to two heads at once, and performing the ritual again while you have three heads destroys one of the old ones. Your heads have an AC of 12 (natural armor), 5 hit points, and darkvision out to 120 feet.</p>
                <p class="indent">Your heads all share a number of charges equal to your Intelligence modifier, and regain 1d4+1 charges at dawn each day. While you’re holding a head, these charges can be used to cast the following spells:</p>
                <p class="indent">Comprehend Languages (1 charge), Augury (2 charges), Speak with Dead (3 charges), Dissonant Whispers (4 charges) and Crown of Madness (5 charges), without material components. When you spend the last charge, roll 1d6. On a 1, the head you’re currently holding turns to dust.</p>
                <p class="indent">Additionally, as an action, you can see through one of your head’s eyes and hear what it hears until you choose to stop. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>
                <p class="indent">You may also choose to set a head somewhere to keep watch. As an action, you can expend 2 charges and cast the Alarm spell instead of with its normal casting time, creating a 20-foot cube area centered on the head. After the duration the head turns to dust.</p>

            <p>Some blood mages, though exceedingly rare, simply love the blood. Be it through an occupation, a mental breakdown, or a deep-seated insanity, a type of blood magic emerged that excels at causing, spreading, sharing, and loving pain, torture, and in the end, blood. These unfortunate few are known simply as Tormentors.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you choose this study at 2nd level, you learn the following spells, which are accounted for on the Spells Known column of the Blood Mage table. These spells are not on the blood mage spell list but they are nonetheless a blood mage spell for you:</p>
